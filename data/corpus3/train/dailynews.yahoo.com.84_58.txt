Afghanistan ( news - web sites ) (Reuters) - Afghan opposition Northern Alliance Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah said Sunday he could not rule out a possible advance toward Kabul in the next few days.
Asked whether there was a chance Northern Alliance forces just north of Kabul would move forward in coming days, Abdullah told a news conference: "We do not rule it out."
He also said declined to say that his forces would not move into Kabul in the case of political vacuum in Kabul.
"A political vacuum is a different situation and we have to consult with our Afghan partners and our international partners, mainly the U.N.," he said.
He said he had been surprised by the speed of the gains made by his forces in the north in the last 48 hours, and said the Taliban had suffered hundreds of casualties.
"I knew the cracks could produce a sort of domino effect and this could get of their (Taliban) control," he said.
