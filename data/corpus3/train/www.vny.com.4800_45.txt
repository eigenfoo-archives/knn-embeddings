Iraq, Jordan to discuss trade expansion BAGHDAD, Iraq, Aug. 24 (UPI) -- A Jordanian ministerial delegation traveled to Baghdad Friday for talks with the Iraqi officials meant to reactivate a $450 million trade protocol agreement and expand economic and trade cooperation. The delegation includes the ministers of trade and industry, energy, agriculture, transportation and health as well as a number of businessmen. Jordan's Minister of Trade and Industry Wassef Azar said his country's ties with Iraq were "historical and strategic" and welcomed improved Iraqi relations with a number of Arab countries, especially Syria. Azar said the team's visit to Baghdad meant to "lay bases for strategic ties between the two countries" and said there were no obstacles for moving ahead with a project for transporting Iraqi crude oil to Jordan via a pipeline. Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh said the visit expressed "the joint wish to consolidate cooperation between the two countries." Saleh noted that Jordan ranks fourth on the list of 75 states benefiting from trade deals with Iraq in line with the 1996 U.N. oil-for-food program and hoped "it would become a main trade partner to Iraq." The Jordanian delegation was to discuss during its four-day visit to Baghdad ways to expand trade cooperation and increase Jordanian exports as part of their $450 million protocol agreement and the oil-for-food program. Last November, Iraq and Jordan agreed to increase their protocol accord from $300 million to $450 million and raise Jordan's exports from Iraqi oil to 5 million tons annually, half of which is for free. Iraq has promised Jordan and three other countries, Turkey, Syria and Russia, to have priority in concluding trade deals under the oil-for-food program. -- Copyright 2001 by United Press International.
