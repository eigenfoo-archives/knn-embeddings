Health Canada has issued a warning about the margarine "Becel Pro-Activ" which claims to lower cholesterol. The department says it's being sold without approval and it may even be dangerous for certain people. 
The Health Canada advisory says the product is made with a plant compound, phytosterols, which the manufacturer, Unilever, claims lowers blood cholesterol levels. According to Statistics Canada, 45 per cent of men and 43 per cent of women have elevated cholesterol levels. 
The product is said to be a "healthy heart margarine that helps manage cholesterol." 
Health Canada says the company is making a therapeutic claim and that means it's considered a drug. To be a drug, the company has to provide evidence the product does what it claims to do. 
According to a release, the department says "phytosterols may pose health risks for certain groups, such as: pregnant women, children, people predisposed to hemorrhagic strokes and people on cholesterol-lowering medication." 
In the European Union and Australia, Becel Pro-Activ is required to carry a label advising that certain consumers may be placed at risk by consuming the product. 
Pro-Activ hit the Canadian market in July. Health Canada advises anyone who has been using this product and is concerned to consult their doctor.
