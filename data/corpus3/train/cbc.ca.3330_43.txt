The federal NDP is calling for a public inquiry into the effects of depleted uranium on Canadian troops and their families. The demand came during an emotional news conference Friday by two veterans who served in the Gulf War but came home sick. 
Perry Holloway and Eldon Berghamer say they fear they're going to die a slow and painful death like former Gulf War veteran Terry Riordon. Traces of depleted uranium were found in Riordon's body nine years after he returned from the Gulf. 
They're also concerned about passing on whatever is making them sick to their partners. Both veterans say one of their symptoms is burning semen. 
At the news conference, NDP MP Wendy Lil read a letter from the former wife of Berghamer, who served in the Gulf War when he was 19 years old. 
In the letter, she said she had eight miscarriages that doctors couldn't explain and when their daughter was born she weighed only two pounds and has suffered many illnesses. 
"I have no way of knowing if all or any of these things are related to Eldon's participation in the Gulf War," she wrote. 
"However, I do think that the military should be helping Eldon to find out if they are responsible and if they are, they should help him." 
The military has said depleted uranium poses no health risk, but has offered to test veterans who think they were exposed. 
Berghamer believes he could have been exposed to the radioactive metal used in weapons during a scud missile attack. 
Some scientists believe soldiers may have ingested depleted uranium dust from exploded weapons and they say that could be harmful. 
The NDP wants a public inquiry and extensive independent testing of sick veterans. 
Defence Minister Art Eggleton said Friday his department has requested more information on depleted uranium from other countries and he's open to the findings.
