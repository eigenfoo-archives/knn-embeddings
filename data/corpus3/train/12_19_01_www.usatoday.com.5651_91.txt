Alabama tries to close its first season under coach Dennis Franchione on a high note when it plays Iowa State in the Independence Bowl. 
Alabama dropped to 3-5 following a 35-21 loss to Louisiana State on Nov. 3, but the Crimson Tide rebounded to win its final three games. They became bowl eligible with a 28-15 victory over Southern Mississippi on November 29. 
While the Crimson Tide's 6-5 record is mediocre compared to Alabama's lofty standards, it still represents a major improvement from last season's 3-8 finish under Mike DuBose. 
Alabama, which lost its final five games last year, is making its NCAA record 51st postseason appearance and also boasts the most bowl wins with 28. But the Crimson Tide have lost their last two bowl games, including a 35-34 overtime loss to Michigan in the Orange Bowl following the 1999 season. 
Quarterback Andrew Zow took over for Tyler Watts in the ninth game of the season and seemed to change Alabama's fortunes, guiding the Crimson Tide to three straight victories. 
Ahmaad Galloway finished the regular season with a pair of 100-yard games to lead Alabama in rushing with 881 yards and six touchdowns. 
Iowa State's Dan McCarney has guided the Cyclones to back-to-back bowl appearances for the first time since 1977-78. Iowa beat Pittsburgh, 37-29, in the Insight.com Bowl last year for its first bowl win in school history. 
Ennis Haywood finished as the second-leading rusher in the Big 12 Conference, running for 1,169 yards and 14 touhdowns on 258 yards. 
Seneca Wallace was named the Big 12's Offensive Newcomer of the Year after passing for 2,044 yards and running for 475. His 2,519 yards of total offense ranks third of Iowa State's all-time list. 
Iowa State is 12-0 over the past three seasons when Haywood rushes for more than 100 yards. He surpassed the century mark five times this year. 
Alabama is facing Iowa State for the first time. The Crimson Tide have an 8-12-1 mark against Big 12 Conference schools.
