Japan may soon have a missile defence system developed in cooperation with the United States. 
The Japanese cabinet endorsed a plan for an intensive research program on Friday, just as Japan put its four Aegis missile warships on stand-by, anticipating possible missile tests by North Korea. 
Officials say North Korea's missile testing spurred Japan's endorsement of the new project. 
The research project being undertaken by Japanese and American scientists will explore an early warning system and batteries of missiles than can knock out incoming missiles. 
So far no country has been able to perfect such a system. The closest, the Patriot missile used in the Gulf War, didn't have a very good record, according to experts. 
The U.S. is now looking to improve that technology and is happy with the help of Japan, a world leader in missile-guidance systems.
