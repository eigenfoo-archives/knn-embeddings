Justice Department officials in the United States say they are facing the threat of more terrorist attacks at home and abroad in the next several days. 
U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft issued the "heightened security alert" Monday for the U.S. or its interests abroad. 
"The administration views this information as credible, but unfortunately does not contain specifics," said Ashcroft. "It should be taken seriously." 
FBI Director Robert Mueller said the information is "not specific as to intended target or as to intended method." 
Ashcroft noted law enforcement agencies across the country are on high alert, and that Americans should be patient if they run into increased security procedures. 
He said people should go about their business, but remain alert, and report any unusual activity to local authorities. 
Ashcroft explained that he is making the threat public not to scare people, but to help prevent an attack. 
The FBI issued a similar warning on October 11, and Ashcroft said a heightened sense of awareness on the part of Americans may have already prevented an attack.
