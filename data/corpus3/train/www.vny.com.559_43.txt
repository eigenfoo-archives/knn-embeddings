Arafat in Beijing to meet Chinese leaders By KIRK TROY BEIJING, Aug. 24 (UPI) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was to meet Chinese President Jiang Zemin later Friday in an effort to muster further international support for the Palestinians in the ongoing crisis in the Middle East. Arafat arrived in the Chinese capital late Thursday after whirlwind stops in India and Pakistan where he also briefed leaders on the situation back home. "The main objective of President Arafat's visit to China is to consult with Chinese leaders concerning the Israeli aggression in Palestine," Arafat spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeina told reporters Friday. China, a long time supporter of the Palestinian cause, is expected to fully back moves by the Palestinians to solve the crisis, including once again throwing its diplomatic weight behind a plan that would provide for international observers. Beijing has long maintained close ties with the Palestinians but in recent years has forged a broadening commercial and military relationship with Israel, which has included a significant number of high-tech arms deals. China has often given Israel the cold shoulder this year following the cancellation of a deal to sell Beijing an advanced radar system after considerable pressure from Washington. "The Chinese government has repeatedly called for restraint of the maximum from both Israel and Palestine, and especially Israel, and urged the two sides to resume negotiations," a statement from China's Foreign Ministry released by state run media said. Beijing established ties with the Palestinian Authority in 1988, the first member of the UN Security Council to do so, and is seen as a main diplomatic supporter of the Palestinians on the world stage. -- Copyright 2001 by United Press International.
