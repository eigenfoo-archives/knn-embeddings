The United States released an updated most-wanted terrorist list on Wednesday. 
Some of the international suspects have been at large for years. The list includes Osama bin Laden, his top two deputies and several members of his al-Qaeda network who were implicated in earlier bombings overseas. 
President George W. Bush said the 22 most hunted men in the world "have put themselves on the list because of great acts of evil." 
"Terrorists live in shadows," said Attorney General John Ashcroft. "We will shine the light of justice on them." 
The FBI has deemed all the elusive suspects to be terrorists. The bureau is offering a reward in the millions of dollars for information on bin Laden's whereabouts. 
FBI director Robert Mueller said authorities are using the power and reach of the world's media to help fight terrorism. 
Also on Wednesday, NATO's secretary general said it will help the U.S. meet its intelligence and other needs in the fight against terrorism. 
"These terrorists are not 10 feet tall," said Lord Robertson after meeting with Bush. "They are not insuperable. They are not unvanquishable. But we are." 
NATO is offering military support to its members and for the first time, NATO surveillance aircraft are on their way to help patrol and defend the U.S.
