Greenhouse gases warm the planet by reflecting heat back to earth, while aerosols keep it cool by bouncing radiation back into space. This balance is already being upset by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, and now Mark Jacobson argues in this week's issue that we are compounding the problem with emissions of black carbon (soot). Black carbon reduces the reflectivity of aerosols and as such may be the second most potent agent of global warming after carbon dioxide (11 February 2001).
