Bill Gramatica made a Cardinal error in judgement on Sunday. 
Gramatica tore the anterior cruciate ligament and cartilage in his non-kicking, right knee celebrating a 42-yard field goal during Arizona's 17-13 loss to the New York Giants. 
The 23 year-old Cardinals placekicker leapt into the air upon splitting the uprights with 7:19 gone in the first quarter, but landed awkwardly. 
Gramatica immediately clutched his knee, but remained in the game. 
He kicked a 23-year field goal with 13:33 left to halftime, but did not return for the second half. 
An MRI revealed a torn ACL and medial meniscus (cartilage). 
Gramatica will require reconstructive surgery that puts his NFL career in doubt. 
Cardinals head coach Dave McGinnis called the rookie's misfortune "most bizarre." 
Drafted in the fourth round out of Florida State, Gramatica converted 16-of-20 field goal attempts and all 25 extra-points in 13 games for Arizona. 
His older brother, Martin, kicks for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
