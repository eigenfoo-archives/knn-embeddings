By Associated Press PHILADELPHIA -- Larry Bowa was given a two-year contract extension by the Philadelphia Phillies on Wednesday, when he won the National League Manager of the Year award.
Bowa led the Phillies to 86 wins in his first season -- the club's first winning year since 1993 and second in 15 years.
"It was a stepping stone," Bowa said. "But I'm not satisfied. I want to improve. I want to get to the World Series."
The Phillies finished second to the Atlanta Braves in the NL East.
"As indicated by the number of honors Larry has received, he did an outstanding job," Phillies general manager Ed Wade said. "We felt he was the right guy for our situation a year ago. It turned out to be the right move. He's a 24-hours-a-day baseball guy who helped our players recognize how good they are."
