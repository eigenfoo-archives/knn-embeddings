Indian army chief General S. Padmanabhan said Wednesday Pakistan was building up troops along the border and India had responded in an "appropriate" manner.
"There is a build-up on the other side. They have moved in certain forces. Certain forces which should have gone back have not gone back and beyond that there is very little to say," he told reporters on the sidelines of a business seminar.
Asked whether India was also moving up troops, he said: "I have acted in whatever manner was appropriate for me to act."
"We are a very confident army. We know our strengths; we know our objectives; we know precisely what we want to do; we are fully capable of looking after all these things," he added.
Tensions have risen between the two nuclear-capable neighbors since an attack on India's parliament on December 13, blamed by New Delhi on Pakistan-based Kashmiri separatist groups.
