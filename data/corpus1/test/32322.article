cleaning up Saturday in the wake of powerful twisters that 
killed 16 people and caused millions of dollars in damages. 
	 Stunned residents in Georgia worked in near-freezing  
temperatures to help clear debris from Friday's tornado, which 
cut a 10-mile trail of destruction, ripping apart several dozen 
homes and two schools. 
	 Public works, electric utility and road maintenance crews  
began work early Saturday morning as mental health workers 
prepared to counsel victims. 
	 The tornado touched down at dawn Friday near Lake Lanier,  
Georgia, about 50 miles north of Atlanta and cut a 
10-mile-by-half-mile path through a rural area. 
	 ``What we're seeing is over $13.5 million in damage,'' said  
Hall County Emergency Management Agency Director Elaine Sexton 
in a preliminary estimate. 
	 ``We all feel it's going to go much higher than that by the  
time we get all the figures in,'' she told reporters. 
	 Sexton said 41 houses and 29 mobile homes were completely  
destroyed and there was partial damage to 132 houses and 16 
mobile homes. 
	 At least 11 people remained hospitalized Saturday, including  
three people in intensive care. 
	 ``I think a number will  be going home today and a couple  
will probably be with us for a while,'' said Dr. Gary Kempler of 
the Northeast Georgia Medical Center. 
	 Officials disposed Saturday of more than 20,000 chickens  
killed when the tornado destroyed nine chicken houses. They were 
still working to dispose of 30 to 40 dead cattle because of 
concern about possible water contamination from decomposing 
animals. 
	 The National Weather Service had not issued a tornado  
warning before the funnel cloud touched down. 
	 ``It wasn't even showing on the radar screens, so there was  
no way to give anyone a warning,'' Sexton said. 
	 Five counties were declared eligible for federal disaster  
relief, making low-interest loans and federal grants available 
for those who need to rebuild homes or businesses. 
	 Federal Emergency Management Agency Director James Lee Witt  
was scheduled to tour the area Sunday. 
	 Those killed in the storm included a 13-year-old girl and an  
older man dumped into a pond by the funnel of wind. 
	 In North Carolina, emergency crews resumed their search  
Saturday for possible victims of a tornado that killed two 
people and devastated tiny Stoneville Friday. 
	 Search dogs were brought in at daybreak to comb through the  
rubble of the downtown business district, where several 
buildings were flattened in this town of about 1,200 people 
along the North Carolina-Virginia border. 
	 ``Everyone is accounted for, but just to make sure,  
emergency crews are going back through the damaged buildings and 
going door-to-door just to check,'' North Carolina emergency 
operations center spokeswoman Lisa Schell said. 
	 North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt toured the ravaged area  
Saturday afternoon and declared a state of emergency in rural 
Rockingham County. 
	 A cold front swept across north Georgia, central North  
Carolina and southern Virginia Friday, ushering in the first day 
of spring with thunderstorms, hail and flooding rains. 
	 Tornadoes touched down in seven North Carolina counties. The  
roof and steeple were peeled off a church in Garner, in central 
North Carolina, and several houses and mobile homes were damaged 
near Danville, in southern Virginia. 
	 In Stoneville, hardest hit by the storms, 12 people were  
hospitalized and 15 others were treated for minor injuries and 
released. One of the victims remained in critical condition 
overnight. 
	 A 24-year old woman was killed and her mother hospitalized  
when their car was thrown into the side of an auto shop and 
buried in debris as the twister roared through town. A 79-year 
old man was thrown from his home and found dead in a nearby 
field, officials said. 
	 ``It really happened so fast that I didn't have time to get  
scared,'' said Annie Mae Myers, who rode out the storm in her 
home.
