home Saturday after 58 years in exile and told the people of the 
violence-plagued Balkan state that restoration of the monarchy 
could unify the country. 
	 Speaking at a news conference shortly after landing to a big  
welcome from supporters in a country he left as an infant, King 
Leka said he would start work immediately on getting Albania's 
emergency all-party government to agree on a referendum on the 
monarchy. 
	 He said the armed turmoil that has swept Albania had come  
about because Albanians had had their political will denied for 
more than 50 years. 
	 ``It is up to the Albanian people themselves to decide  
through a referendum whether they want a monarchy or republic,'' 
King Leka said, adding he did not want to predict the outcome. 
	 ``We have to give people the chance to express their will.  
Independent of the outcome, I will respect their will.'' 
	 ``I hope I am a unifying factor, a factor that can bring  
together all the diverse political and religious and national 
hopes,'' he said. ``I hope I can cooperate with any entity that 
is working toward justice and law and order as well as 
freedom.'' 
	 When asked why he returned to the country where nearly 300  
people have been killed in lawlessness provoked by the collapse 
of popular get-rich-quick investment schemes, King Leka replied: 
``My people are suffering.'' 
	 King Leka, who received a thunderous welcome from nearly  
2,000 Albanians as he arrived at Tirana airport by private plane 
>from  South Africa, was only a few days old when his father, King 
Zog, fled the country with his family in 1939. 
	 The tall, bespectacled monarch King Leka only once tried to  
visit Albania, in 1993. He was unceremoniously deported less 
than 24 hours after he arrived on the grounds that his passport 
marked ``Kingdom of Albania'' was invalid. 
	 ``According to the 1928 constitution, which I still consider  
in force, I was automatically proclaimed king when my father 
died in 1961,'' said King Leka, who at 6 feet 5 inches, towers 
over most of his countrymen. 
	 ``So willingly or not, I became the king of Albanians.''  
	 Switching between English and Albanian, a language he speaks  
fluently but with distinctly archaic words, King Leka said he 
hoped to meet with rightist President Sali Berisha and Prime 
Minister Bashkim Fino of the leftist Socialist Party as soon as 
possible. 
	 ``I plan to stay as long as is necessary,'' the king said.  
	 Although the pro-monarchy Legality Movement Party polled  
only about 5 percent in the last election in 1996, the party now 
has 52,000 members, double the number of two years ago. 
	 Many Albanians said they were surprised by the enthusiastic  
welcome King Leka received. ``In a country with no hope, he 
gives us hope,'' said one middle-aged man. 
	 King Leka told the news conference: ``There is a question of  
legitimacy, there is a legal question. Until the constitution is 
abrogated or changed by a referendum it is still a binding 
factor. 
	 ``Until such time as the Albanian people can freely express  
themselves, which I hope will be soon, it is up to them to make 
that decision.'' 
	 King Leka is staying in a $300 per night suite in a luxury  
hotel in central Tirana. It would take the average Albanian 
worker four months to earn enough for a night in his suite. 
	 When asked what had triggered the mayhem in Albania, King  
Leka said: ``It is frustration, very simple frustration and 
anger of a nation that has not been allowed to express itself.''
