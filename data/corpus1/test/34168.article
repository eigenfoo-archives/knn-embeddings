Somalia since April 15 were released Friday and arrived back 
safely in Nairobi a few hours later, the International Committee 
of the Red Cross (ICRC) said. 
	 They were met at Nairobi's Wilson Airport by hugs and kisses  
from family members, friends and colleagues. 
	 The ICRC said it paid no ransom for their release.  
	 ``We stuck it out together in a quite amazing way,'' said  
Tehmas Gurtner of Switzerland, the only one of the freed 
hostages to address a news conference in Nairobi on his return. 
	 ``We are all relatively well. We have had some difficult  
periods but in the end we survived and I must also say that we 
had overall a time of detention that was not too horrible for 
us,'' said Gurtner, 41. 
	 The hostages were kidnapped by unidentified gunmen when they  
landed at an airstrip in north Mogadishu. Gurtner said they were 
guarded mainly by four or five men from a much larger group and 
kept in a single large room. 
	 He said the worst moment came when a foreign camera team  
entered the compound to film, putting the hostages in danger. 
	 ``The most tense moment was created -- and I hope you don't  
see this as too much of a criticism of the general press -- when 
a camera team, an international camera team, forced access into 
the compound after apparently paying off some militia...'' 
	 ``They forced their entrance and actually used some of the  
militia, almost inciting them, to create the most dramatic 
effect. There I thought I was not going to survive that,'' 
Gurtner said. 
	 Worldwide Television News (WTN) and Associated Press  
Television (APTV) were the only two foreign camera teams to film 
inside the hostages' compound. 
	 APTV in London said in a statement: ``APTV has no knowledge  
of these allegations. We've got a cameraman who remains in 
Somalia in very dangerous conditions.'' 
	 Guy Ker, deputy managing editor of WTN in London, said: ``We  
operated under the strictest rules of international engagement. 
We were very, very insistent that no one was put in any 
situation. We got the first pictures out. We understand that our 
scoop incited rivals to acts of desperation.'' 
	 Pictures from inside the compound were shown around the  
world on Monday and the ICRC said it was ``extremely worried'' 
for the safety of the hostages. 
	 Gurtner said the release was arranged with the cooperation  
of Mogadishu's main faction leaders including north Mogadishu 
faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed, south Mogadishu leader Mohamed 
Hussein Aideed and Ali Hassan Osman Ato. 
	 ICRC official Patrick Berner said the ICRC did not pay a  
ransom demand or talk directly to the kidnappers. Instead the 
ICRC, and particularly the Somali Red Crescent society, put 
pressure on Mogadishu's elders and politicians, Berner said. 
	 Seven of the hostages were from the ICRC, two from the  
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies 
and one from the Somali Red Crescent society. 
	 Besides a Somali water engineer, the workers included two  
Swiss, an American, a Norwegian, a German agricultural 
specialist, a Belgian, a French nurse, and two pilots from South 
Africa and Kenya. 
	 Ali Mahdi, speaking shortly after the hostages were  
released, apologized for the incident on behalf of Somalis. 
	 The kidnap embarrassed Ali Mahdi since the hostages were  
held in his north Mogadishu stronghold by a group of militiamen 
not under his direct control. 
	 Ali Mahdi said no ransom had been paid for their release,  
which he said had been arranged through traditional channels. 
	 But one of the hostage-takers, Hassan Ali, claimed $100,000  
had been given to the local militia group, apparently as a 
contribution from local Somalis. 
	 Somalia has been without central government since 1991, when  
Mohamed Siad Barre was ousted by rival clans. Since then the 
country has fractured into clan-based fiefdoms.
