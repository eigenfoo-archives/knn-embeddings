feared dead Thursday when a torrent of mud and rock swept over a 
crowded family campsite in the Pyrenees mountains of northern 
Spain, state radio said. 
	 All victims identified so far are Spanish, but the radio  
said six holidaymakers from Germany, France and Belgium were 
among the dead. The campers also included British and Dutch 
tourists. 
	 Police said the task of identifying the victims of Spain's  
worst such disaster was complicated because most lacked identity 
documents. 
	 King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia flew to the disaster area  
to comfort relatives of victims as rescue workers battled to 
pull bodies from a mudslide triggered by heavy rains. 
	 State radio said 68 bodies had been recovered and 150 people  
had been injured. About 40 campers remained unaccounted for, 
raising fears the toll might rise into the 100 range, it added. 
	 The campsite outside the town of Biesca, 130 km (90 miles)  
east of the city of Pamplona, was filled to capacity with 
families when freak rains hit Wednesday evening. 
	 It was engulfed in seconds when the rains triggered floods  
that turned into an avalanche of mud and rocks, sweeping cars 
and trailers up to one km (1,000 yards) away and dragging some 
of the bodies up to 15 km (10 miles) downstream. 
	 One hospital official said 129 injured remained in hospitals  
in nearby Jaca and Huesca, all of them Spanish. 
	 Rescuers expressed frustration at the difficulty of  
recovering bodies. 
	 ``You feel impotent,'' one teary-eyed volunteer told state  
television. ``You want to (pull them out) and you can't. In 
those moments, you look toward heaven and do what you can.'' 
	 Like the royals, who flew in from their Majorca palace,  
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar interrupted his beach holiday to 
inspect the damage first-hand. 
	 ``I have flown over the area -- it's a dreadful he  
told reporters. 
	 Rescue teams recovered the computer disk drive containing  
information on guests at the campsite, but found it was 
illegible after being damaged in the flood. 
	 Officials feared dozens more bodies could still lie  
downstream in a river near the ``Virgen de las Nieves'' (Virgin 
of the Snows) campsite. 
	 ``It all happened in a flash -- I can't explain it, it was  
like a giant wave carrying off everything, the cars, the 
trailers,'' one survivor told Spanish television. 
	 ``It was a matter of seconds, not even minutes. The main  
street in the campsite was a river of mud, between one and two 
metres (three and six feet) deep.'' 
	 Another survivor, visibly shocked, described from his  
hospital bed how he had to give up helping other people swept 
away by the flood in order to save his own life. ``There comes a 
moment when it's you or nobody,'' he said. 
	 Wrecked cars, flattened caravans and other remnants littered  
the area. 
	 Rescuers pulled 26 bodies from the mud before breaking off  
overnight, their work hampered by a blackout and by blocked 
roads. They were joined by the army and by military divers when 
the search for victims resumed at daybreak Thursday. 
	 One man who survived by grabbing hold of a branch said he  
had watched bodies being swept past in the strong flow. 
	 Hundreds of people were evacuated from the area to a sports  
stadium in the town of Biescas where they were given food and 
shelter, a doctor said. 
	 Eighty children were evacuated from a camping site in nearby  
Pineta for fear the river Cinca would burst its banks.
