persuade the Palestinian Authority to send more negotiators to 
Washington to talk to a large Israeli delegation, State 
Department spokesman James Rubin said Monday. 
	 ``They are not here. A significant part of the morning was  
spent discussing that without them we won't be able to make any 
progress. That is what they are working on now and trying to get 
them here,'' Rubin said at his daily briefing. 
	 Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy and senior Palestinian  
negotiator Mahmoud Abbas met U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright Monday morning, shortly before the time set for the 
start of the substantive Israeli-Palestinian talks. 
	 But the Palestinians have not sent to Washington their  
experts on what are known as the interim issues -- steps Israel 
agreed to take long ago but has not yet taken. 
	 ``The secretary is concerned the Palestinian delegation was  
not in a position to discuss some of the interim issues related 
to the airport, the seaport, the industrial park (in Gaza) ... 
We are trying to fix that,'' Rubin said. 
	 Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Sunday he was sending  
Abbas to meet Levy at the Washington-area talks ``only because 
we received an official invitation from Madeleine Albright.''
