Vanilli, has been found dead in a Frankfurt hotel room, 
Germany's Bild am Sonntag newspaper said Sunday, quoting the 
artist's ex-manager. 
	 Pilatus was found dead on his hotel bed Friday evening with  
blood around his nose and mouth. Doctors at the scene diagnosed 
heart failure. 
	 Police were unable to confirm the report. A spokesman said  
they would be informed of a death only if circumstances had been 
suspicious. 
	 Milli Vanilli's former manager Frank Farian told Bild am  
Sonntag that Pilatus had just come out of drug rehabilitation. 
	 ``I'm totally shocked. Rob looked really good again after  
his therapy, and was full of optimism,'' Farian said. 
	 Bild said no post mortem had yet been carried out and it was  
too early to say whether drugs were responsible for Pilatus's 
death at the age of 32. 
	 Pilatus, together with U.S. partner Fabrice Morvan, had sold  
30 million singles and 14 million albums since hitting the 
charts in 1988 with songs like ``Girl You Know It's True'' and 
``Girl I'm Gonna Miss You.'' 
	 But fans were outraged when it emerged that the dreadlocked  
duo had not sung on their own records and had mimed onstage to 
playback tapes. 
	 Milli Vanilli's career went rapidly downhill after that, and  
it was Pilatus's various brushes with the law, and not the 
group's music, which started making headlines. 
	 Farian said that Pilatus had been planning a new start and  
had been due to fly to India from Frankfurt to complete his drug 
therapy program. 
	 ``We knew already Thursday that he had drunk some of his  
travel money,'' Farian told Bild am Sonntag. ``We knew that he 
was taking tablets which were very dangerous in combination with 
alcohol. 
	 ``From Friday lunchtime on we called him in his hotel. He  
didn't pick up the phone. In the end we had to break into his 
room. But Rob had already been dead for 18 hours.'' 
	 Pilatus was born in New York, but grew up with adoptive  
parents in Munich, where he was expected to be buried.
