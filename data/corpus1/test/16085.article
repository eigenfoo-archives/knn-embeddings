still hung in the air Saturday as Japan's Prime Minister Ryutaro 
Hashimoto toured the burned-out ambassador's home where Tupac 
Amaru rebels held captives for 126 days. 
	 The elegant white-brick mansion that housed Latin America's  
longest-ever hostage siege has turned into a rotting shell, 
littered with the debris of battle two weeks after Peruvian 
troops rescued 71 hostages in a violent raid. 
	 The walls -- charred from explosions and riddled with bullet  
holes -- were testament to the bloody gunbattle that killed all 
14 Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) rebels, one hostage 
and two commandos April 22. 
	 Built as a mockup of the antebellum home in ``Gone with the  
Wind,'' the colonnaded mansion in a quiet street of the upscale 
San Isidro district is now a filthy eye-sore, whose stench after 
weeks of being overun by rats refuses to die away. 
	 ``It was really eerie, like going to a wake or something.  
Everything was burned black and the smell was horrible'' said 
Reuters photographer Eriko Sugita, who accompanied Hashimoto 
around the home. 
	 Hashimoto inspected the battered ceiling and floor of the  
home's reception room, where commandoes exploded out of tunnels 
through the floor while the rebels played indoor soccer. He 
gingerly moved through the tall rooms strewn with broken doors 
and shattered windows. 
	 Before moving outside, the Japanese leader -- on a one-day  
visit to Lima to thank President Alberto Fujimori for ending the 
crisis -- passed the grand stairwell where rebel leader Nestor 
Cerpa died in a hail of bullets. 
	 With his score of dark-suited bodyguards, Hashimoto sedately  
strolled around the untended gardens. Beneath a now dirty-white 
marquee he sidestepped the still-upturned tables and battered 
Christmas tree used to decorate the ambassador's ill-fated 
lavish cocktail party. 
	 Outside, in scenes reminiscent of the crisis, journalists  
jostled with security force officers to gain the best view of 
the compound and, evoking memories of provocative police 
tactics, a helicopter circled overhead.
