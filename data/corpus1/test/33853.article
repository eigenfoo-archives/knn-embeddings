as the only tangible proof of Christ on earth, dismissed by 
others as a medieval fake, goes on display this weekend for the 
first time in 20 years. 
	 Some 800,000 people from all over the world have already  
booked to see the yellowing linen cloth, which will be displayed 
from Sunday in a glass case in Turin's cathedral. 
	 It will only be the fourth time this century that the public  
has had a glimpse of the sheet some Christians believe wrapped 
the dead body of Christ after his crucifixion. The last time the 
Shroud was seen in public was in 1978. 
	 The fragile relic nearly failed to make it for this year's  
display, timed to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the 
first photograph which revealed to the world the blood-stained, 
ghostly image of a bearded man with shoulder-length hair. 
	 Fire ripped through Turin's 15th-century Duomo in April last  
year and the treasured cloth, furled inside an ornate silver 
casket, was only saved after a courageous fireman smashed 
through its protective glass case and spirited it to safety. 
	 The Shroud, bearing as it does the apparent marks of torture  
and crucifixion that correspond with Gospel accounts, is one of 
Christianity's most revered relics, but also one of its most 
baffling and controversial. 
	 ``No one's ever going to prove the cloth is the Shroud of  
Christ -- for that matter, how can you prove Christ,'' Rex 
Morgan, a Shroud expert and author of four books, told Reuters. 
	 ``It's a matter of faith...What is so fascinating is that it  
just hasn't been written off,'' said the Australian, who first 
became interested in the Shroud in 1978 when he saw it in Turin. 
	 Moved by the mystery -- not least of how the image came to  
be visible on the cloth in the first place -- more than 3 
million people flocked to Turin that year, some lining up for 
seven hours. 
	 But within 10 years, the Shroud's reputation was in ruins.  
	 Scientists in Oxford, Zurich and Tucson, Arizona, conducted  
carbon-dating tests on carefully snipped samples of the cloth in 
1988 in a bid to solve the mystery once and for all. 
	 Their sensational result was that the Shroud dated from  
between 1260 and 1390 -- suggesting it was a medieval fake. 
	 Despite the furor their verdict caused, supporters remain  
convinced the aged linen sheet is the same cloth that wrapped 
the dead body of Christ nearly 2,000 years ago in Jerusalem. 
	 Ian Wilson, another Shroud expert, wrote last week that  
along with Easter, he would now be cautiously celebrating ``the 
resurrection of the Shroud.'' 
	 ``In the past three years new scientific evidence has  
emerged to show that the radiocarbon scientists might have been 
seriously wrong in believing that their dating of the Shroud in 
1988 was conclusive,'' he wrote in Britain's Sunday Telegraph. 
	 ``For those who conducted the radiocarbon-dating tests did  
not know that the Shroud was encrusted in barely visible living 
bacteria,'' he said, adding they had been detected by two 
University of Texas microbiologists, Professor Stephen Mattingly 
and Dr Leoncio Garza-Valdes. 
	 ``The millions of micro-organisms that have attached  
themselves to the Shroud throughout its history are bound to 
produce seriously misleading results if, as happened in 1988, 
their carbon content is dated along with the linen proper... 
	 ``In other words, those radiocarbon-dating tests of 10 years  
ago were not the last word,'' he wrote. 
	 Morgan agrees.  
	 ``In no way has that put an end to the mystery. In fact,  
it's increased the mystery,'' he told Reuters. 
	 ``The carbon-dating tests suggested the shroud was medieval.  
Anyone who knows anything about the shroud...knows the great 
proportion of evidence suggests it can't possibly be medieval.'' 
	 The Vatican, which inherited the relic from Italy's former  
royal family in 1983, is careful not to claim authenticity. 
	 But asked what he would say to doubters, Cardinal Fiorenzo  
Angelini told Reuters: ``Pay as much attention as possible to 
the scientific research...Dispassionate scientific research is 
enough.'' 
	 Don Giuseppe Ghiberti, one of the church's most senior  
shroud officials, was equally noncommittal. 
	 ``I can't say with absolute certainty (whether it is  
authentic). Maybe we will never be able to say,'' he told 
Reuters. 
	 Cardinal Giovanni Saldarini, Turin's Archbishop and the  
custodian of the Shroud, will formally inaugurate the two-month 
exhibition with a mass Saturday. Pilgrims can view it beginning 
Sunday and Pope John Paul himself is expected to visit in May. 
	 For him, the Shroud also has particular memories.  
	 The pontiff's predecessor, John Paul I, took office the day  
before the shroud went on show in 1978. He died just 33 days 
later, while it was still on display, thrusting the Vatican into 
a conclave that named the Polish Pope as his successor.
