this weekend in a troubled Indonesian province rose to at least 
nine, police said today. One report said 13 people died, including 
two army officers. 
	Violence erupted Sunday in Aceh province after soldiers raided  
several buildings believed to harbor rebels who have been fighting 
for an independent Islamic state. Furious residents attacked the 
security forces, who responded with gunfire. 
	In the former Portuguese colony of East Timor, another region  
where separatist rebels operate, fighting between groups that 
oppose and support independence left two people dead. 
	The separatist activists were fatally shot during an attack  
Sunday on a security post occupied by military-backed civilians 
near the East Timorese capital of Dili, the army said. Five people 
were injured. 
	Indonesia has been plagued by outbreaks of civil unrest over the  
past year, and several separatist movements have grown bolder since 
the ouster in May of former authoritarian President Suharto. 
	His successor and onetime protege, President B.J. Habibie, has  
faced sometimes violent protests by students and is struggling to 
revive the Southeast Asian nation's shattered economy. Ethnic and 
religious tensions have also set off riots. 
	Violence had recently escalated in Aceh province, where the  
military suspended a decadelong campaign against rebels in the 
province at the northern end of Sumatra island and apologized for 
human rights abuses. 
	The military conducted dawn raids around the town of Lhokseumawe  
and arrested 132 people after villagers and suspected rebels killed 
seven soldiers and kidnapped two others last week. 
	Nine people died in the coastal town, including at least one  
soldier, police Maj. Amrin Remico said by telephone. Authorities 
earlier said six died. 
	But Suara Karya, a national daily, reported that 13 people died  
in fighting in Lhokseumawe and the nearby district of Pidie. 
Rioters burned at least 15 buildings, including police and military 
posts and local government offices. 
	Hundreds of people were injured, many of them shot. It was not  
known if the soldiers were using plastic bullets or live 
ammunition. 
	Hundreds of troops were deployed Monday across Lhokseumawe, a  
center of Indonesia's oil and gas industry, and there were no 
reports of fresh violence. 
	The military had aimed to reduce tensions by ceding control of  
most security matters in Aceh to local community leaders, but that 
plan appears to be on hold for now. Lhokseumawe was hit by 
anti-military riots several times in 1997. 
	Similar resentment toward the military runs deep in East Timor,  
which was invaded by Indonesia in 1975 and annexed a year later. 
Activists allege widespread human rights abuses by the armed 
forces. 
	U.N.-sponsored peace talks on East Timor are underway between  
Indonesia and Portugal, which the United Nations still considers to 
be the administering power. 
	But many East Timorese separatists reject Jakarta's offer of a  
measure of autonomy, preferring a vote on independence. The 
government has not offered an autonomy deal to the Acehnese.
