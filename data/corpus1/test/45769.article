a third night of heavy bombardment on the eve of a Moslem holy month 
as the Baghdad regime mocked the US-led air blitz as "a real 
failure." 
   Britain warned that the punitive raids launched Wednesday night  
were far from over. 
   At least 10 missiles struck Baghdad overnight and rocked  
apartment buildings in two separate waves, with both a general 
hospital and a maternity hospital reported to have been hit. 
   Before the last raid, Iraqi Health Minister Umid Medhat Mubarak  
said at least 25 people had been killed and 75 wounded in the 
capital alone, all of them civilians. 
   Casualty figures from the provinces were not available, and  
access of foreign journalists to sites of bomb damage has been 
restricted. 
   British warplanes entered the fray on Thursday, as London  
insisted the attacks would carry on as long as Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein failed to surrender banned weapons of mass 
destruction. 
   "This is not the end of it," said British Defence Secretary  
George Robertson, adding however that London and Washington were 
"very sensitive" of the fact that Ramadan was about to begin. 
   The start of the Moslem month of dawn-to-dusk fasting, the  
holiest period in the Islamic calendar, is determined by the 
sighting of the new crescent moon. 
   Britain's 12 Tornado fighter-bombers took part in both overnight  
raids from an air base in Kuwait, in what a British military 
official called "a rolling programme of missions." 
   A second aircraft carrier, the USS Carl Vinson, arrived in the  
Gulf region on Thursday, giving US commanders the means to step up 
the tempo. The carrier doubled the navy attack aircraft used so 
far. 
   Spearheading the manned missiles in Operation Desert Fox, US  
pilots on the carrier USS Enterprise have pounded Iraq with more 
than 200 raids, their commander said Friday. 
   In their briefing room, US pilots riding high on the adrenaline  
of night-time raids had their own codename: "Operation: Kill 
Saddam." 
   US and British forces, which have not reported any losses, were  
expected to mount heavier and heavier air and missile attacks to 
avoid a spillover into Ramadan. 
   Iraq's military intelligence headquarters in Baghdad, Special  
Republican Guard headquarters and Republican Guard barracks were 
among the targets struck on Wednesday, according to US officials. 
   The US National Security Adviser, Sandy Berger said the US-led  
strikes have also inflicted heavy damage to Iraq's arms production 
facilities, apart from its military assets. 
   But Iraq said the onslaught has proved "a real failure" on the  
political front and called for UN arms chief Richard Butler to be 
put on trial for initiating the attacks. 
   "The US military aggression has been a real failure at the  
political level," said Babel, a daily run by Saddam's eldest son 
Uday, adding that Washington was being isolated. 
   Another official newspaper called for Butler to go on trial for  
his negative report on Iraqi cooperation that prompted Washington 
and London to launch their onslaught. 
   On the diplomatic front, Russia vented its fury by recalling its  
ambassador from London, a day after taking the same step with its 
envoy to Washington. 
   Moscow has circulated a draft statement to the Security Council  
that would "regret" the use of force against Iraq. 
   Another key member of the Security Council, China, expressed  
"deep regret" on Friday at the strikes. 
   Arab demonstrations against the US-British offensive also picked  
up on Friday, a traditional day for protests after Moslem weekly 
prayers. Up to 10,000 protested in both the West Bank and Sanaa. 
   The Iraqi envoy to the United Nations, meanwhile, rejected US  
claims that chemical weapons-producing facilities were being damaged 
in the attacks. The sole objective was to weaken Saddam and his 
government, he said. 
   On Thursday, US planes on bombing runs over southern Iraq  
dropped "subversive" leaflets, according to an Iraqi information 
ministry official. 
   It was the first such action in several years in the south, the  
scene of a  Shiite uprising that was crushed in the aftermath of the 
1991 Gulf War. 
   US President Bill Clinton said last month, during a previous  
crisis over weapons inspections, that a new government in Baghdad 
was a long-term aim of the United States. 
   Another information ministry source said Friday that Saudi  
armoured units advanced to the Iraqi border the previous day on an 
apparent reconnaissance mission before pulling back. 
   On the ground, the United Nations evacuated some 100  
humanitarian workers from Baghdad on Friday to ensure their safety, 
leaving behind only a skeleton team of 28 international staff. 
   But oil exports have not been affected and stockpiles of food  
are still "significant," according to UN officials.
