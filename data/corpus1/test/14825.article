demolished the West Bank home of a Palestinian suicide bomber 
who killed three Israeli women in a Tel Aviv cafe 10 days ago, 
witnesses said. 
	 They said the Israeli army imposed a curfew on the village  
of Surif near Jerusalem as a bulldozer wrecked the second floor 
of the house in which the 28-year-old bomber Mousa Ghneimat, his 
wife and four children lived. 
	 Israel's High Court rejected an appeal on Sunday by the  
Ghneimat family against the destruction, which Palestinians and 
human rights groups view as collective punishment. Judges ruled 
the measure is a legitimate form of deterrence. 
	 The suicide bombing followed Israel's ground-breaking for a  
Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem, which outraged 
Palestinians and plunged the peace process into crisis. 
	 Israeli soldiers have clashed daily with Palestinian stone  
throwers in the West Bank since construction at Jabel Abu 
Ghneim, called Har Homa by Israel, began on March 18. 
	 Witnesses said soldiers wounded two Palestinians in the head  
with rubber bullets near the West Bank town of Jenin on Monday. 
	 Arab foreign ministers meeting in Cairo on Sunday agreed to  
recommend their countries suspend normalisation with the Jewish 
state in response to the settlement building. 
	 ``It was an important meeting in which we discussed in  
detail the Israeli breaching of what has been agreed upon 
and...the decision was clear and obvious -- to put on the 
correct line in the peace process,'' Palestinian President 
Yasser Arafat said in English in Gaza on Monday upon his return 
>from  Cairo. 
	 Israel claims all of Jerusalem as its capital. Palestinians  
view East Jerusalem, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle 
East war, as capital of their future state.
