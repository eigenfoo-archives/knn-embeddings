a four-day U.S. visit, will have a working luncheon with 
President Clinton Thursday in which talks will focus on the 
crisis over U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq. 
	 In other developments, two permanent members of the U.N.  
Security Council, whose resolutions on eliminating Iraqi weapons 
of mass destruction are being defied by Baghdad, criticized U.S. 
readiness to force compliance. 
	 Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen told U.S. Secretary of  
State Madeleine Albright on Thursday that Beijing did not favor 
the use of force against Iraq, the Xinhua news agency said. 
	 Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Wednesday bluntly  
challenged the wisdom of Clinton's threats to use military air 
strikes against Iraqi targets, saying that such action raised 
the specter of ``a world war.'' 
	 But Sergei Lavrov, Russia's envoy at the United Nations,  
later played down Yeltsin's remarks, saying they had been 
distorted and Yeltsin had been reacting to U.S. media reports 
that suggested tactical nuclear weapons might be used against 
Iraq. 
	 U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said Wednesday he  
expected approval within the next day or two for additional U.S. 
troops, aircraft and ships to head to the Gulf region as 
Washington continued to prepare for possible military action. 
	 Blair, leader of the United States' only committed ally in  
any military offensive against Iraq, had a 10-minute phone 
conversation with Yeltsin before leaving for Washington. 
	 Blair said there must be ``a real threat of force and the  
use of force if necessary'' against Iraq to back demands for 
free access to military installations. 
	 Blair's press spokesman said Yeltsin expressed worries about  
the use of force against Baghdad but did not use strong 
language. 
	 ``He obviously voiced his concern about that course of  
action, although not in quite the same terms as earlier. ... 
There was certainly no dramatization of that sort,'' the 
spokesman said, referring to Yeltsin's earlier warning about a 
world war. 
	 Yeltsin voiced his concern during a televised meeting in the  
Kremlin as Russia pursued diplomatic efforts to end the Iraqi 
standoff. 
	 ``We must try at the same time to make Clinton feel that  
with his actions in Iraq he can lead to a world war,'' Yeltsin 
said at the meeting with First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly 
Chubais. ``He is acting too noisily there,'' Yeltsin said. 
	 Russian officials were put on the defensive after Yeltsin's  
comments and tried to minimize their importance. 
	 ``This is a very unfortunate distortion of the entire  
exchange. He was reacting to the reports in the media here that 
officials here do not exclude the use of tactical nuclear 
weapons against Iraq,'' Lavrov told reporters in New York. 
	 In his telephone conversation with Albright, Qian said,  
``Chinese President Jiang Zemin is deeply concerned about the 
current crisis over the Iraqi weapon inspection, which is 
increasingly deteriorating,'' according to Xinhua. 
	 ``China does not favor the use of force against Iraq,'' Qian  
was quoted as saying. 
	 Beijing has urged Baghdad, however, to comply with U.N.  
inspectors' demands for unlimited access to suspected weapons 
sites. 
	 Cohen said on CNN's ``Larry King Live'' that Marine Corps  
Gen. Anthony Zinni, chief of the U.S. Central Command with 
responsibility for the Middle East, had requested additional 
resources and Clinton was reviewing the matter. 
	 ``Whatever (the president) feels is necessary, I'm sure we  
will approve of. ... Within the next day or two we would expect 
that,'' he said. 
	 Cohen, who is heading to the Gulf region Sunday to discuss  
the escalating crisis, stressed that Washington was still 
seeking a diplomatic solution. 
	 Defense sources said Zinni requested additional  
radar-avoiding stealth fighter jets, bombers and Marines to 
augment U.S. troops already in or near the Gulf. 
	 As the public posturing continued in the showdown between  
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and the United Nations, diplomats 
in New York and U.S. officials in Washington dismissed an offer 
to let U.N. teams into eight presidential palaces that Baghdad 
had previously insisted should be off-limits. 
	 Ewen Buchanan, spokesman for the U.N. Special Commission  
(UNSCOM) in charge of Iraqi disarmament, said it appeared 
Baghdad's proposal was a one-time offer and inspectors would not 
be allowed to return to the sites. 
	 He pointed out that one of the presidential sites in  
downtown Baghdad ``contains hundreds of buildings which would 
under this proposal appear to be out of bounds.'' 
	 He said it appeared the proposals ``are at odds with ...  
demands by the council for immediate, unconditional and 
unrestricted access.'' 
	 The proposal, similar to one that was turned down in  
November, was considered certain to be rejected by the Security 
Council, diplomats said. 
	 White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry told reporters  
that ``insofar as we understand the current Iraqi proposal, it 
does not meet the criteria'' of full compliance. 
	 ``The fact that the government of Iraq is now seeming to  
recognize that there is going to have to be some additional 
access to sites and they can't continue to block so-called 
presidential sites -- that is certainly some indication that 
they are beginning to get the message,'' McCurry said. 
	 Clinton, who spoke by telephone with Egyptian President  
Hosni Mubarak, said he was encouraged that a consensus was 
developing that Iraq must comply with U.N. resolutions on 
destroying its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. 
	 ``All of us would prefer a genuine diplomatic solution. I  
want to reiterate that to every single American,'' said Clinton, 
whose military advisers have been reviewing possible targets for 
military strikes if diplomacy fails. 
	 ``The best way to stop Saddam from building nuclear,  
biological or chemical weapons is simply to get the 
international inspectors back to work with no restraints,'' 
Clinton said at the White House. 
	 ``I will say again, one way or the other, we are determined  
to deny Iraq the capacity to develop weapons of mass destruction 
and the missiles to deliver them,'' Clinton said. ``That is our 
bottom line.''
