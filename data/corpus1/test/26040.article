piled pressure on Israeli and Palestinian leaders on Saturday, 
telling them to make key decisions on peace before a new round 
of meetings in less than two weeks' time. 
	 Albright said after talks in Geneva with Palestinian  
President Yasser Arafat that she had arranged further separate 
meetings with him and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
somewhere in Western Europe. 
	 ``We will be able at that stage, I think, to move forward,''  
she told a news conference. ``As I have said to both of them, 
they have some work to do and some decisions to make before we 
have those meetings.'' 
	 Albright later flew back to Paris and held her second  
meeting there with Netanyahu in two days. 
	 U.S. officials said that Albright, who sets off on Monday on  
a seven-nation Africa tour, expected to see Netanyahu and Arafat 
again after a NATO meeting she will attend in Brussels on 
December 16-17. 
	 Albright is demanding from Israel a ``credible'' new troop  
pullback in the West Bank and a freeze on Jewish settlements. 
From the Palestinians she wants a firmer commitment to shield 
Israel from attack by Muslim extremists. 
	 Her goal is to move to negotiations on the ``final status''  
of Palestinian self-rule areas in the West Bank and Gaza. 
	 It is only three weeks since Albright last met Netanyahu and  
Arafat in Europe, and aides said she was bent on concrete 
results in the peace process, stalled for the past nine months, 
before the end of the year. 
	 ``She believes we are in a serious phase where serious  
discussions are possible,'' a senior U.S. official said. 
	 Albright said she had held ``useful and constructive'' talks  
with Arafat and that Israel and the Palestinians ``should be 
able to come to closure soon'' on so-called interim issues left 
over from past agreements. 
	 Officials said these included opening a Palestinian airport  
and setting up safe passage between the West Bank and Gaza. 
	 The officials said a key focus of the talks with Arafat was  
the fight against ``terrorism.'' She said she told Arafat this 
required ``100 per cent effort.'' 
	 ``Terrorists are unrelenting and efforts against them have  
to be unrelenting,'' Albright said. 
	 Arafat said the Palestinians had no objection to proceeding  
to final status negotiations, but that Israel could not skip 
over its obligations under past accords, which include troop 
withdrawals. 
	 ``There is no doubt that this (final status talks) is linked  
also to the faithful and accurate implementation of the various 
previous agreements,'' he said. 
	 An official briefing reporters on condition he was not  
identified said that despite apparent stalling by Netanyahu on 
the extent and timing of a pullback, Albright's efforts were 
making headway. 
	 ``Three weeks ago we had the central question of could there  
be a further redeployment,'' the official said. ``Now we are 
into the nuts and bolts of a further redeployment.'' 
	 In Paris there was a much more pessimistic assessment from  
French President Jacques Chirac, who told Netanyahu on Saturday 
that Israeli initiatives fell short of what was needed to 
unblock the peace process. 
	 ``The Israeli government's proposals do not appear to us to  
be of the kind to revive the peace process and build mutual 
confidence in the region,'' spokeswoman Catherine Colonna quoted 
Chirac as telling Netanyahu during an 80-minute meeting. 
	 Before meeting Albright on Friday, Netanyahu said his  
government, which approved the principle of a pullback on 
Sunday, would need several more weeks to work out the details. 
Even then it would require five months of security cooperation 
from the Palestinians to put it in place, he said. 
	 Albright said Netanyahu had not mentioned the five month  
proposal to her. 
	 Israeli media reports say Netanyahu may offer the  
Palestinians a further six to eight percent of the West Bank. 
Palestinians have demanded up to 30 percent, and U.S. officials 
have suggested they hope to split the difference.
