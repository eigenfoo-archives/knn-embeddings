Cousteau revealed and explored an underwater world more 
fantastic than anything forseen by the 19th-century science 
fiction writer Jules Verne. 
	 He died on Wednesday, aged 87. ``Captain Jacques-Yves  
Cousteau has gone to the world of silence,'' his foundation 
said. 
	 In his trademark sea-blue tunic, Captain Cousteau became a  
familiar figure through his books and films, particularly the 
U.S.-sponsored television series ``The Undersea World of 
Jacques-Yves Cousteau,'' which was first shown in 1965. 
	 A member of the prestigious French Academy since 1988 and  
one of France's most popular men, he was a vigourous campaigner 
against marine pollution, and joined international protests 
against France's nuclear testing in the South Pacific in 1995. 
	 Cousteau crusaded for environmental protection from  
Antarctica to the Amazon river to the depths of the oceans. 
	 In 1978 he spent $900,000 on a toxic waste survey in the  
Mediterranean. He told interviewers he had stopped swimming in 
the sea off Monaco because it was so polluted, although 20 years 
before he had swum every day. 
	 ``I haven't the time to go 10 or 12 miles offshore to find  
clean water,'' he said. 
	 With his marine laboratory in the Calypso, a converted  
British minesweeper, he toured the world's oceans. 
	 One of Cousteau's most striking achievements was in 1962  
when he set up the world's first manned underwater station on 
the continental shelf near Marseille. Two men remained in the 
underwater house ``Diogenes'' without surfacing for over a week. 
	 His most recent invention was a wind-powered vessel with  
smokestack-like devices which suck in air currents and redirect 
them through vents and vanes to propel the craft forward. 
	 The first time he set out in such a boat, the 42-tonne  
``Windmill,'' in October 1983, gale-force winds left him 
stranded in the middle of the Atlantic. But he set off again in 
May 1985 for a 2 1/2 year voyage on a newer version of the craft, 
the 70-tonne Alcyone, named after the son of the Greek god of 
wind. 
	 Cousteau said his propulsion system, which uses neither fuel  
nor sails, could save up to 40 percent in fuel for cargo ships 
and help revolutionize sea transport of the future. 
	 Born on June 11, 1910, in the southwestern wine-growing  
region of Bordeaux, Jacques-Yves Cousteau spent his childhood in 
Paris and New York, and studied at the naval academy in Brest. 
	 He acquired a rudimentary movie camera at the age of nine,  
the first step to an illustrious film-making career that won him 
three Oscars and three awards at the Cannes film festival. 
	 The mystery of the sea first fascinated him as a young naval  
officer in Indo-China, when he watched a Chinese fisherman dive 
without breathing apparatus or weapons to catch fish by hand. 
	 Except for the war years spent in the Resistance, Cousteau  
was a naval officer from 1930 until 1950, when he resigned from 
the service and started serious ocean studies in the Calypso. 
	 In 1943, Cousteau and Emile Gagnan, a French engineer, built  
the first operational skin-diving suit which enabled divers to 
shed their heavy helmets and swim freely for up to two hours. 
	 His team of divers unearthed the wreck of an ancient Greek  
wine freighter in 1952, bearing thousands of valuable pottery 
pieces, from fossil mud off the coat of Marseille. 
	 He and his son, Jean-Michel, set out in 1982 on an 11-month  
expedition along the Amazon River to chart the wilderness. 
	 Cousteau sees dumping non-degradable toxic wastes as the  
greatest danger to the ocean in the next decade. ``We have no 
right to put this product in contact with the water system. It's 
a delayed genocide,'' he told interviewers. 
	 He has two sons, Jean-Michel and Philippe, from his late  
first wife Simone. Philippe was killed in Portugal when a flying 
boat he was piloting capsized. Cousteau remarried in 1991. 
	 In 1995 he sued Jean-Michel for using the Cousteau name to  
advertise a Fiji islands resort. The case was settled when his 
son added his first name to the resort to avoid confusion with 
the Cousteau Society, a non-profit environmental group. 
	 Among Cousteau's most notable films are ``The Silent  
World,'' ``World Without Sun'' and ``The Golden Fish'' and his 
books include ``The Voyage of the Calypso'' and ``Through 18 
Metres of Water.'' 
	 Asked when he was 71 if he was getting too old to dive, he  
replied: ``Age doesn't count...After all, my father started 
diving at the age of 67.''
