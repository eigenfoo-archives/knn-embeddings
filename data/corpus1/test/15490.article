besieged Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima where Marxist 
rebels were holding 72 hostages. 
	 About 15 men in ski masks and military fatigues entered the  
compound carrying rifles. One man in civilian clothes was seen 
in the compound with blood coming from his leg. 
	 Witnesses said that two explosions and gunfire were also  
heard at the diplomatic compound as security forces swarmed in. 
	 At least 10 hostages clambered out across the roof. Some  
were not wearing trousers. 
	 Guerrillas of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA)  
have been holding 72 hostages in the residence, which they 
stormed on Dec. 17.
