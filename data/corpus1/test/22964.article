Nobel Prize for Economics for pioneering work which has laid the 
foundation for the rapid growth of derivatives markets in the last 
ten years. 
   Robert Merton, 53, a professor of business administration at  
Harvard University, and Myron Scholes, 56, a finance professor at 
Stanford University, were honoured for devising a "new method to 
determine the value of derivatives." 
   Their work, in collaboration with fellow American Fischer Black  
who died in 1995, "stands out among the foremost contributions to 
economic sciences over the last 25 years," the Nobel jury added. 
   A derivative is a financial contract whose value derives from an  
underlying asset, such as a share certificate, a coffee crop or the 
output of a gold mine. Many derivatives seek to insulate producers 
from risk. 
   The first derivative contracts provided finance for the shipping  
trade routes and industrial revolution during the late 18th 
century. 
   In recent years, the size and complexity of derivatives markets  
has grown exponentially, owing to the removal of barriers to flows 
of capital, dramatic growth of capital available for investment, and 
above all the complex calculations and dealing offered by new 
technology. 
   These extremely volatile markets have been at the root of many  
of the most high-profile trading losses seen in recent years. 
   The near collapse of Britain's oldest merchant bank, Barings,  
and multi-billion-dollar losses that last year rocked giant Japanese 
bank Sumitomo were unleashed amid the web of derivatives trading. 
   Derivatives values are a problem in finance that have been  
tackled for most of this century. 
   In 1973, Black and Scholes published the Black-Scholes formula,  
"a pioneering formula for the valuation of stock options," the jury 
said. 
   Thousands of traders and investors now use this formula every  
day to value stock options in markets throughout the world. 
   Merton devised another method to work out the formula that  
turned out to have a wide applicability, and he generalised the 
formula in many directions. 
   "Their methodology has paved the way for economic valuations in  
many areas. It has also generated new types of financial instruments 
and facilitated more efficient risk management in society," the jury 
said. 
   Stock options allow for hedging against one-sided risk --  
options give the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a 
certain security in the future at a pre-specified price. 
   A prerequisite for efficient management of risk, however, is  
that such instruments are correctly valued, or priced. 
   Merton, Scholes and Black showed that it is not necessary to use  
any risk premium when valuing an option. The risk premium does not 
disappear, but is already included in the stock price. 
   Their research "has become a massive economics industry and has  
probably done more than anything else to justify the vast salaries 
of academic types on Wall Street and in the City," said David Webb, 
the London School of Economics director of financial markets. 
   "Their work has made a lot of people very rich," he added.  
   Merton and Scholes will receive the prize, and a shared cheque  
for 7.5 million kronor (one million dollars), at an official 
ceremony in Stockholm on December 10, the anniversary of the death 
of Swedish scholar and industrialist Alfred Nobel in 1896. 
   The economics prize, established in 1968 by Sweden's Central  
Bank to commemorate its tricentennial, is the most recent of the 
Nobel awards. 
   Since it was first awarded in 1969, 26 Americans have won it,  
against seven Britons, two Swedes, two Norwegians and one each from 
Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the former Soviet 
Union. 
   In recent months, a dispute has erupted over the Economics  
Prize, with the Swedish Academy calling for its abolition because it 
was not one of the five prizes established by Alfred Nobel in his 
will, written in 1895 in Paris. 
   The first Nobel prizes -- for physics, chemistry, physiology or  
medicine, literature and peace -- were awarded in 1901 and are 
funded by Nobel's estate, unlike the economics award which is funded 
by the Swedish Central Bank. 
   The Swedish Academy, which each year awards the Literature Prize  
but not the Economics Prize, has submitted a proposal to the Nobel 
Foundation, which oversees all of the Nobel prizes, calling for the 
change. 
   The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences meanwhile has said it sees  
no reason to abolish the Economics Prize.
