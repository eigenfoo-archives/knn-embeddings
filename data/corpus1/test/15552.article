rocketed in opinion polls following the storming of the Japanese 
ambassador's residence that rescued 71 of the 72 hostages. 
	Leading pollster, Apoyo, says 67 percent of people interviewed  
Wednesday approved of Fujimori's performance in government, up nearly 30 
points on the latest poll result four days ago. 
	Apoyo said Fujimori's approval rate has boomeranged from a low of 38  
percent in its latest poll released April 20. 
	Fujimori had suffered a sharp 10-point drop in the first half of the  
month because of a scandal involving intelligence service agents. 
	The intelligence service was involved in digging a network of tunnels  
under the residence that were used to free the hostages. One hostage, 
two soldiers and all 14 rebels died in the rescue operation. 
	The discovery of the mutilated body of a woman intelligence agent and  
allegations that another woman agent was tortured by colleagues for 
purportedly leaking information to the press had dragged the president's 
rating down. 
	The Apoyo poll, carried out among 420 people in Lima Wednesday, found  
that 52 percent of those interviewed said they ``regretted'' the deaths 
of the 14 leftist rebels killed in the attack. But, 42 percent said they 
did not regret these deaths. 
	Apoyo chief researcher Alfredo Torres said that in poorer areas the  
number of people who lamented the deaths of the rebels was a few points 
higher.
