toppled President Suharto in May, at least five people were killed 
today when Indonesian security forces battled rock-throwing 
protesters and street mobs attacked suspected police informers. 
	Student activists said more than 50 people were injured in  
clashes with police, who fired plastic bullets, tear gas and water 
cannons at the protesters. At least two were hospitalized in 
critical condition. 
	Mobs burned tires while baton-wielding soldiers dispersed the  
crowd. Armored personnel carriers rumbled along Jakarta's main 
boulevard, and troops fired warning shots and chased thousands of 
protesters through Jakarta's downtown area, where offices and shops 
were closed. 
	Soldiers were seen firing what appeared to be blanks and plastic  
bullets into buildings at Atama Jaya Catholic University. Several 
students, some bleeding, were later taken out on stretchers. 
	Tosik Sutina, a morgue official at the nearby Jakarta Hospital,  
said two bodies, both male students, had been brought from the 
university with gunshot wounds to their chests. 
	Other hospitals reported a steady stream of injured.  
	Syaiful, a morgue attendant at Cipto Mungunkusomo Hospital, said  
it received the bodies of one male student and a civilian security 
guard. Both also had gunshot wounds to their chest. 
	In East Jakarta, a mob beat a third man to death in a street  
while soldiers looked on. Witnesses reported dozens of other mob 
attacks against individuals accused of being police informers. 
	The clashes followed two deaths -- a high school student and a  
police officer -- in similar street battles Thursday night in 
Jakarta. More than 100 students were hospitalized, some with 
serious injuries. 
	Today, students marched from at least three campuses in the  
capital in defiance of military warnings. They attempted to march 
on Parliament where a special government assembly was putting the 
final touches on a new political blueprint for the troubled 
Southeast Asian nation. 
	Clashes continued after dark as security personnel fired warning  
shots into the air. Thousands of students and others ran for cover 
and threw rocks and bottles at riot police and troops. 
	Military commander Gen. Wiranto had called for calm today and  
warned that an estimated 30,000 police and troops deployed across 
the capital would take ``firmer action'' if student protests got 
out of control again. 
	In an interview with private radio station Trijaya, Wiranto  
suggested that people stay at home and that offices remain closed. 
	Wiranto defended the tough action taken by his men to put down  
Thursday's protests, which he said had been an ``unlawful attempt 
to forcibly occupy the parliament by mobs.'' 
	The violence since Thursday night has been the worst in Jakarta  
since riots forced Suharto to quit in May after 32 years in power. 
Foreign embassies in Indonesia have warned their citizens of the 
likelihood of more unrest. 
	Meanwhile, today, about 1,000 student protesters blocked the  
runway and airplane parking lots at the airport in Ujungpandang, 
capital of South Sulawesi province, the privately owned SCTV 
television station reported. Airport authorities canceled at least 
six flights because of the demonstration. 
	The demonstrators oppose a special government assembly convened  
by Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, to map out a new 
political system at a time when Indonesia is battling with its 
worst economic crisis in decades. Inflation, unemployment and 
poverty rates are soaring. 
	Habibie, a former protege of Suharto, says the People's  
Consultative Assembly, the nation's top legislative body, will pave 
the way for free elections next year. Critics say assembly 
delegates are Suharto holdovers intent on preserving their 
political privileges. 
	The assembly was expected to announce a date for the elections  
and to support new laws to legalize many political parties. 
Students, however, demand greater democratic change, including an 
end of military involvement in politics. They also want Suharto put 
on trial for corruption and human rights abuses. 
	In concession to student demands, factions in the assembly have  
agreed to name Suharto in a decree calling for an investigation 
into past corruption.
