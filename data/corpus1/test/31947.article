eagerly waited Sunday for a presidential invitation to form the 
next government, and played down a rift with an ally who gave 
grudging support. 
	 President K.R. Narayanan was expected to invite the  
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to lead India after it cobbled 
enough support to come within a whisker of a clear majority in a 
fragmented parliament. 
	 While Narayanan deliberated, much of the nation's attention  
was fixed on Italian-born Sonia Gandhi's ascent to the 
presidency of the Congress party, reviving the Nehru-Gandhi 
family's domination of India's oldest political party. 
	 The Hindu revivalist party, often called the ``saffron''  
party in a reference to its orange colors, won the largest 
number of seats in the hung parliament but has had to pull 
together a mixed bag of allies in order to rule. 
	 Narayanan met a clutch of leaders from small parties on  
Saturday in a weekend of consultations as he sought to find a 
stable government from the fractured lower house, Lok Sabha. 
	 ``Let the letter come (from Narayanan). I am hoping the  
letter may come anytime in the evening or by tomorrow morning at 
the latest,'' BJP spokesman Venkaiah Naidu told reporters. 
	 Narayanan looked increasingly obliged to assess the BJP  
coalition's claim on the right to rule after a reluctant 
regional ally on Saturday finally joined the Hindu nationalist 
camp, albeit with harsh words for the alliance it decided to 
back. 
	 The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and  
its minor allies from the state of Tamil Nadu offered letters of 
support from 27 lawmakers for the BJP. 
	 The AIADMK's backing brought the total support won by a  
BJP-led alliance to 264, just eight short of the 272 required to 
clinch a majority in the Lok Sabha. 
	 But AIADMK leader J. Jayalalitha lambasted the BJP, alleging  
that her state's leaders were treated as ``inferior'' during 
talks last week and raising a set of tough demands that appeared 
to put the BJP's would-be government on notice. 
	 ``There is no question of any reaction from the BJP (on the  
AIADMK criticism),'' Naidu said after a meeting of the BJP and 
its allies in New Delhi on Sunday. ``There seems to be some 
communication gap, some misunderstanding.'' 
	 Naidu said the BJP would take steps to remove misgivings.  
	 The United News of India (UNI) said senior BJP leader  
Jaswant Singh had a 90-minute meeting with Jayalalitha in the 
southern city of Madras. Details of the meeting were not known. 
	 ``There will be no problem,'' said Mamata Banerjee, whose  
regional Trinamool Congress will contribute seven lawmakers to 
the nascent coalition. ``If there is a will, there is a way.'' 
	 The BJP and its allies, to stem any further trouble, on  
Sunday decided to put off the release of a ``national agenda'' 
made with allies to form the basis of a new government. 
	 ``We will be releasing the national agenda at the time of  
the formation of the government, not before,'' Naidu said. 
	 Much attention at the weekend has been focussed on the  
appointment of Sonia Gandhi to lead the vanquished Congress 
party. 
	 Congress has ruled India for all but five of the 50 years  
since independence from Britain. 
	 For most of those years it was led by the family Sonia  
married into, which supplied three prime ministers: Jawharlal 
Nehru, his daughter Indira Gandhi and her son, Sonia's 
assassinated husband, Rajiv. 
	 Congress leaders removed octogenarian leader Sitaram Kesri  
to make way for Sonia, as she commonly known by admirers in her 
adopted country.
