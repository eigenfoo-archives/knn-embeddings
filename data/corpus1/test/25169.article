Palestinian Authority on Thursday over a shooting attack in 
Jerusalem's Old City that killed one Jewish seminary student and 
wounded another. 
	 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met top cabinet ministers  
and security officials to discuss the shooting and announced he 
would hold a news conference on that and other issues at 5 p.m. 
(1500 GMT). 
	 He described the shooting in an official statement as  
``severe and intolerable.'' 
	 Ehud Olmert, the Israeli mayor of Jerusalem, said Arafat was  
doing nothing to prevent attacks by Islamic militants opposed to 
peacemaking with Israel. 
	 ``These are people who have automatic weapons, who are  
organised in cells, who have escape routes, who have logistical 
help to escape and hide,'' he said. 
	 The students, members of a right-wing Jewish settler  
movement, were ambushed overnight while returning to a 
settler-owned home deep in the Old City's Moslem quarter in what 
police said was probably a Palestinian guerrilla attack. 
	 ``In other attacks that took place in Jerusalem we  
determined without a doubt that these wretched terrorists came 
from areas under the control of the Palestinian Authority,'' 
Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh told Israel Radio. 
	 ``And the fact is that in recent months terrorists of the  
Hamas and Islamic Jihad were released from jails of the 
Palestinian Authority,'' he said, referring to Islamic militant 
groups behind suicide bombings that have killed scores of 
Israelis. 
	 Twenty-six people were killed in Jerusalem attacks in July  
and September including five Hamas suicide bombers. 
	 Israel traced the bombers to a West Bank village under the  
Jewish state's security control but says they were aided by 
militants operating in PLO self-ruled areas. 
	 The shooting came a week after Israeli troops shot a  
seven-year-old Palestinian boy in the head in the West Bank town 
of Bethlehem. Ali al-Jawareesh died on Saturday after being shot 
about 200 metres from the site of Arab-Israeli clashes. 
	 The two students left their religious seminary of Ateret  
Cohanim -- a right-wing group dedicated to settling Jews in the 
Moslem quarter and other parts of the Arab East Jerusalem -- 
when they came under automatic fire just after midnight. 
	 One student died instantly. A police spokesman identified  
him as Gabriel Hirshberg, 26. Fellow students said he had 
immigrated recently from Hungary. 
	 The other shooting victim was severely wounded but managed  
to reach policemen stationed nearby. 
	 Police spokesman Shmulik Ben-Ruby told Reuters: ``We are  
almost certain it was a terrorist attack.'' 
	 Witnesses said bloodstained clothes and bullet casings were  
scattered on the ground where the two students, both wearing 
skullcaps of religious Jews, were shot. 
	 Ateret Cohanim called on the government to respond by  
launching a Jewish settlement in Ras al-Amoud, a neighbourhood 
in Arab East Jerusalem where Jewish settlers took over a home in 
September, exacerbating a crisis in peacemaking with PLO. 
	 ``It is inconceivable that the government will succumb not  
only to threats but to this murderous act in Jerusalem. We need 
an immediate Zionist response to the killing of a Jew inside the 
Old City,'' Ateret Cohanim leader Mati Dan told Army Radio.
