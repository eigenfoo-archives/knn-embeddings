completed their demobilization with a celebration at one of the U.N.- 
monitored camps set up for the disarmament. 
	Former rebel leaders and government officials attended the ceremony  
at the Sacol camp in Alta Verapaz province, 140 miles (230 km) north of 
Guatemala City. 
	Of the nearly 3,000 former rebel combatants who handed in their  
weapons at the eight camps set up for the disarmament, most returned to 
their families. About 500 who had nowhere to go remained as civilians at 
the Tuluche (``too-LOO'-chay'') camp in northern Quiche (``kee-SHAY''') 
province. 
	The demobilization followed the signing of peace accords on Dec. 29  
that brought an end to 36 years of civil war in Guatemala. 
	The principal leaders of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Union,  
or URNG, a rebel umbrella group, on Thursday joined in Labor Day marches 
for the first time. 
	The URNG is currently forming a political party. Leader Jorge  
Monsanto (``HOR-hay mohn-SAHN-toh'') said the process should take about 
a year-and-a-half to complete, and that the group will be ready to run 
in the 1999 elections.
