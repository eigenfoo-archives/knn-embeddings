Angeles suburb Thursday, sending burning wreckage crashing into 
a house and an apartment complex and killing both pilots and 
another person, police and aviation officials said. 
	 ``Two aircraft crashed into a condominium and a house,'' a  
Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman said. 
	  The cause of the crash between a twin-engine Cessna 310 and  
single-engine Cessna 152 was not yet known, the FAA said, adding 
that two bodies had been recovered at the site of the crash of 
the twin-engine plane. 
	 It was not immediately clear whether the third person killed  
was a passenger and officials said they had no information on 
the identity of the victims. 
	 The crash sparked fires at the house and the four-unit  
condominium complex in Corona, about 40 miles east of Los 
Angeles. The house and condominium complex were across a golf 
course from each other. 
	 ``(The planes) appeared to be heading right toward each  
other,'' an eyewitness, Michelle Lanksbury, told KABC-TV. ``It 
was pretty much a head-on crash. One of the wings (of one plane) 
was knocked off. It was amazing how it floated around in the 
air, almost like a piece of paper.''
