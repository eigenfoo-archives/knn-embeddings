17-hour clashes between rival monks vying for control of the 
headquarters of South Korean Buddhism, witnesses said Tuesday. 
   The Chogye Temple in central Seoul was restored to a tense peace  
Tuesday morning following ferocious overnight fights which left 
almost 40 monks and followers of the order injured. 
   But hundreds of police in full riot gear and brandishing batons  
and shields maintained a tight cordon around the usually peaceful 
temple to thwart further violence. 
   It was the worst violence at the temple since clashes upset the  
election in early November of a chief administrator to take charge 
of finances and management for hundreds of temples across South 
Korea. 
   The fights deepened divisions among South Korea's 10 million  
Buddhist followers who have seen their headquarters change hands 
through violent clashes several times in the past three decades. 
   In 1993, riot police raided the temple to end a bout of violent  
rivalry, sparking an anti-government campaign. 
   On Tuesday, the opposing groups of monks accused each other of  
seeking to take illegal control of temple management and ignored 
appeals by neutral groups to hold a fair election. 
   The battle, watched by thousands of riot police, started at noon  
Monday when about 1,000 monks forced their way through barricades to 
oust rival monks holed up at the temple's five-storey administration 
building. 
   The gray-robed clerics battled it out with each other as  
hundreds of riot police were drafted in to seal off the area and 
prevent the violence spreading. 
   Sporadic fights continued until 5:00 a.m. (2000 GMT) on Tuesday,  
with both sides hurling rocks and bottles under police floodlights. 
   The wounded included a domestic newspaper photographer who  
suffered serious head injuries. One monk was seen bleeding profusely 
from the face in a pre-dawn fistfight. 
   Supporters of the most followed Buddhist order cleaned up the  
grounds littered with stones, bottles, broken sculptures, logs and 
furniture. Some monks brandished steel pipes. 
   Most of the injuries came during vicious fights around the  
administration building occupied by some 100 monks who hurled 
firebombs and rocks to stop opponents from breaking in. 
   "Why don't they stop fighting," one woman said as she swept the  
grounds. 
   The Buddhists have divided into two groups -- the Purification  
and Reform Committee (PRC) and the Constitution Safeguards Committee 
(CSC). 
   PRC members occupied the temple two weeks ago, saying they were  
the mainstream supported by chief monk Wolha. But the rival faction 
accused them of seeking illegal control of the temple's 
administration. 
   Buddhism is South Korea's most followed religion with 15  
centuries of deep-rooted tradition. But its modern history has been 
marred by factional fights and political interference. 
   The rivals Tuesday launched a war of words outside the serene  
wooden temple building which dates from around 1910, refusing to 
ease their demands. 
   Chisun, one of the CSC's head monks, accused police of failing  
to stop the fight. But police said they were ordered to avoid 
interfering in the temple's internal problems. 
   "We will not back off. We will fight on to oust those who have  
illegally occupied the building," he said. 
   Wontal, a PRC chief monk, demanded a change in election rules,  
saying the powers of the administration should be reduced.
