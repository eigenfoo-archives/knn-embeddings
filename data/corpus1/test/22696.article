Pacific coast today partially destroying Acapulco and other resort towns 
and leaving as many as 62 people dead and thousands homeless. 
	The Mexican government announced a national emergency plan, ordering  
the army and navy out to help residents in the states of Guerrero 
(``geh-reh-roh''), Oaxaca (``wah-hah-KAH'') and Michoacan (``mee-chwah- 
KAHN''), in what was described as the worst hurricane to hit the area in 
the last 20 years. 
	The Department of Firefighters in Acapulco, 170 miles south of Mexico  
City, said 62 people died, as Pauline's heavy rains flattened roofs, 
trees, telephone and electricity lines. More than 20 people were 
reported missing. 
	The Ministry of the Interior confirmed 37 people have died -- 35 in  
Guerrero and two in Oaxaca. 
	According to radio reports, the torrents of water and mud that poured  
down Acapulco's streets from the hills behind the city swept away cars 
and an entire church. 
	Firefighters department chief Rene Lobato told said, ``I don't want  
to be alarmist, but I believe we're facing a situation of total 
disaster.'' 
	The hurricane hit the poorer coastal areas of Acapulco, Huatulco,  
Puerto Angel and Puerto Escondido, and the Guerrero state capital, 
Chilpancingo, particularly hard. 
	Acapulco schools were shut and residents advised to stay inside safe  
structures or seek refuge in hotels or buildings on higher ground, as 
rain continued to fall. 
	Pauline was moving north along the Pacific coast at 15 mph with  
maximum sustained winds of 100 mph. A hurricane warning is effect from 
Puerto Escondido in Guerrero to Manzanillo in the state of Colima.
