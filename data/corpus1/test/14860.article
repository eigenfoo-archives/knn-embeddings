derailment on the outskirts of Madrid Tuesday only hours after a 
devastating train crash claimed the lives of 18 passengers in 
northern Spain, officials said. 
	 Investigators combing through the twisted wreckage at both  
crash sites ruled out sabotage, but the accidents -- which took 
place about 174 miles apart -- raised new questions about the 
safety of Spain's national rail system. 
	 Authorities continued the grim task of identifying mangled  
bodies pulled from the ``Miguel de Unamuno'' passenger train, 
which derailed Monday night in the northern town of Huarte 
Araquil in Spain's worst train disaster in nearly two decades. 
	 ``Some bodies were completely destroyed, so it is very  
difficult to identify them,'' Navarre regional president Miguel 
Sanz told reporters. 
	 On the front page of its Tuesday editions, the Spanish  
newspaper Diario 16 summed it up with a large, one-word 
headline: ``CATASTROFE.'' 
	 Relatives who kept an overnight vigil were overcome with  
grief to learn their loved ones were among the dead. ``Why did 
this have to happen to me?'' wailed one mother over the loss of 
her young son. 
	 The train was crowded with families returning home from a  
long Easter holiday weekend. Ninety-four of the 248 passengers 
were injured in the crash. 
	 People trapped in the wreckage screamed for help, and rescue  
crews worked through the night scouring through the debris. 
victims. Forty-nine of the injured remained in local hospitals 
Tuesday. 
	 Officials of the Spanish rail company RENFE said ``excessive  
speed'' was the likely cause of the crash. They said the train 
approached the station at 85 miles per hour when it should have 
slowed down to 20 miles per hour. 
	 Less than 10 hours after the Huarte Araquil crash, a train  
travelling from Barcelona to Malaga with 54 passengers on board 
derailed before dawn while changing tracks near Azuqueca de 
Henares, about 20 miles northeast of Madrid. 
	 Spain's King Juan Carlos expressed his condolences to the  
victims' families, and Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar pledged 
to provide whatever assistance was needed.
