close to resolving an ominous shipping dispute Friday, with the 
Japanese ambassdor reporting agreement on the broad outlines of a 
settlement. 
   "I think we have succeeded in resolving most of the outstanding  
problems," Ambassador Kunihiko Saito announced after talks with US 
Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat. 
   "There are some details still to be worked out but I am  
confident our experts will be able to resolve these remaining 
details." 
   Saito suggested the Federal Maritime Commission, which on  
Thursday called for a ban on cargo ships from three Japanese 
companies seeking to enter US ports and the detention of those 
already at berth, had been asked to reconsider its decision. 
   "We hope the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) will act  
accordingly, taking into account the progress we have made up to 
now. 
   "The government of Japan hopes that when agreement is officially  
reached between the two governments ... all sanctions will be 
lifted." 
   A spokesperson at the FMC said late Friday no decision had been  
made on whether or not to go ahead and ask the US Coast Guard and 
Customs Service to implement the ban. 
   Saito's announcement, made in the presence of Eizenstat, came  
after intensive negotiations between US and Japanese officials to 
avert what many feared would be the start of a debilitating trade 
war. 
   "We're hopeful that very shortly the details will be concluded,"  
Eizenstat said, adding that such an agreement could come by the end 
of the week end. 
   The FMC decided Thursday to move against cargo ships from three  
Japanese companies that had failed to pay four million dollars in 
punitive fines due Wednesday. 
   The commission imposed the fines -- 100,000 dollars every time  
one of the vessels called at a US port from abroad -- in September 
on grounds that Japan had failed to ease costly restrictins on 
foreign ships operating in Japanese ports. 
   The request to the Coast Guard and the Customs Servive had been  
expected to take effect Friday evening. 
   In Friday's talks, according to Eizenstat, Japan agreed to  
streamline the licensing procedures at its ports and to create an 
independent agency to monitor the harbor system. 
   US shipping companies have in particular complained about a  
"prior consultation" requirement, obliging them to negotiate with 
Japanese harbor officials every time they want to alter a port 
procedure. 
   In addition, US firms want the right to use their own stevedores  
in Japan, an option they say Japanese companies enjoy in US ports.
