brilliant mathematician accused of being the shadowy Unabomber 
who killed three people and injured 28 others during a 17-year 
mail-bombing spree, goes on trial Wednesday with officials 
calling him ``too dangerous'' to live. 
	 The Harvard-educated academic who gave up life as a  
professor at the University of California in Berkeley to become 
a hermit in the backwoods of Montana was accused of mailing a 
series of bombs in a deadly anti-technology campaign. 
	 Published reports this week say defense lawyers Quin Denvir  
and Judy Clarke are trying to negotiate a plea-bargain with 
prosecutors that would send Kaczynski to jail for the rest of 
his life but would spare him the death sentence. 
	 But legal experts said such a deal was unlikely since the  
government clearly wants a public whipping. 
	 One source close to the case, who insisted on anonymity,  
said, ``They want this trial out in the open and they want 
Kaczynski's head. They are not going to settle for anything less 
than the death penalty.'' 
	 In court papers arguing for the death penalty, Robert  
Cleary, head of the FBI's Unabomber Task Force, wrote that 
Kaczynski was ``too dangerous'' to be allowed to live. 
	 The Unabomber, so-named by the FBI because his initial  
targets were universities and airline offices, started his 
terrorist campaign in 1978. 
	 For the next 17 years the Unabomber taunted the FBI and  
other law enforcement agencies as he continued to mail explosive 
packages to victims who were involved in technology or were seen 
by the Unabomber as working to destroy the environment. 
	 According to the FBI, three people were killed and another  
28 were badly injured in 16 blasts caused by the Unabomber. 
	 In early 1996, when Kaczynski emerged from the shack where  
he had lived without power or plumbing for 25 years and 
surrendered, the FBI announced that the long hunt for the 
Unabomber was over and took him off its ``most wanted'' list. 
	 His arrest, on a tip from Kaczynski's own brother, ended one  
of the longest manhunts in the history of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation. 
	 Kaczynski, 55, is being tried in in Sacramento because that  
is where two of his victims were killed when they picked up 
packages that exploded and another two maimed for life when they 
opened letter bombs mailed to them from Sacramento. 
	 Kaczynski pleaded not guilty to 10 bomb-related charges,  
including the murders of Sacramento computer store owner Hugh 
Scrutton in 1985 and timber industry lobbyist Gilbert Murray in 
1995, the Unabomber's last victim. 
	 The other charges involved bombs injuring San Francisco  
geneticist Charles Epstein and Yale University computer 
scientist David Gelernter. Both bombs were mailed from 
Sacramento. 
	 Kaczynski faces a later trial in New Jersey in the 1994  
bombing death of an advertising executive there. He pleaded 
innocent in that case also. 
	 Legal experts said the prosecutors, led by Cleary, have an  
overwhelming ``mountain of evidence'' against the defendant. 
	 ``This is not a 'whodunit' case. It's more of a 'why did he  
do it?' case,'' said Joshua Dressler, a professor at McGeorge 
University law school in Sacramento. 
	 To this end, Kaczynski's lawyers indicated in numerous court  
papers that they intend to present a ``diminished 
responsibility'' defense, claiming their client suffers from 
paranoid schizophrenia and was mentally incapable of forming the 
intent to kill. 
	 When the trial begins Wednesday with jury selection, the  
prospective panelists will be grilled by U.S. District Judge 
Garland Burrell on their willingness to impose the death penalty 
should they find Kaczynski guilty. 
	 In a motion filed Monday, defense lawyers asked Burrell to  
allow them to question prospective jurors too. 
	 Jury selection, from a pool of about 600 Sacramento  
residents, is expected to take at least one month. The 
so-called ``guilt or innocence'' phase of the trial will last 
for another four months and if Kaczynski is found guilty, the 
penalty phase of the trial will follow.
