nations Sunday ended a summit that gave Russia new clout in 
their exclusive club and celebrated a sound global economy, but 
otherwise broke little new ground. 
	 The only drama of the three-day meeting was a brief health  
scare when Russian President Boris Yeltsin complained of 
tiredness and went back to his hotel Saturday night instead of 
attending an entertainment gala with his summit colleagues. 
	 Yeltsin, who underwent heart surgery last year, rebounded to  
complete his full schedule on Sunday and said he felt 
''excellent.'' A Denver hospital dispatched an ambulance to his 
hotel on Saturday just in case but it was never needed. 
	 Leaders of the Group of Seven -- the United States, Germany,  
Britain, France, Canada, Italy and Japan -- embraced Russia as 
everything but their eighth member as they ended their 23rd 
annual summit in this Rocky Mountain city. 
	 ``We now feel stronger because we have Russia as a  
partner,'' said President Bill Clinton in a concluding news 
conference. 
	 Though Russia was excluded from a single session on economic  
issues, Clinton predicted the dividing line between Moscow and 
the group would be increasingly blurred. 
	 German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Russia at some stage wil  
host a summit of the eight while French President Jacques Chirac 
spoke of a ``Group of Eight.'' 
	 The summit leaders said the global economy was in good shape  
but warned that there may be problems ahead. The final 
communique expressed concern over Japanese trade surpluses and 
the high unemployment in continental Europe and said the United 
States must prevent its booming economy spinning into inflation. 
	Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto tried to fend off  
criticism, saying, ``I do not think that Japan's trade and 
services surplus will increase significantly.'' 
	The communique took policy positions on a broad array of  
topics -- supporting a global ban on human cloning and further 
research on AIDS and other infectious diseases. 
	 But it failed to achieve a breakthrough on controlling  
pollutants blamed for global warming -- the most contentious 
issue at the low-key and largely scripted gathering -- and could 
not tackle two disputes involving NATO. 
	 European leaders appealed to the United States to agree to a  
15 percent reduction in pollutant gases blamed for global 
warming by 2010. The U.S. side would not agree to a specific 
target on this and left it over for wrangling at Earth Summit 
II, a U.N.-sponsored environment conference that begins Monday 
in New York. 
	 ``We couldn't get any more on that,'' said Kohl of the  
absence of agreement on a specific target. ``The Europeans are 
simply further along (than the Americans).'' 
	 Clinton renewed his vow to bring 8,500 U.S. troops home from  
a 31,000-strong peace-keeping force in Bosnia in a year's time 
despite European concern that a pullout could prompt a new cycle 
of bloodshed. ``Our policy is the mission should be completed by 
June 1998 and we expect it to be,'' Clinton said. 
	 European leaders, particularly Italian Prime Minister Romano  
Prodi, had appealed to Clinton to reconsider at a time when 
Bosnia's hard-won peace looks increasingly fragile. 
	 On NATO expansion, Prodi prodded Clinton -- to no apparent  
avail -- to accept both Slovenia and Romania as new members in 
addition to Hungary, Poland and the Czech Repubic. 
	 The three new prospective members are to be invited to join  
the military alliance at a summit in Madrid in two weeks time. 
	 China remains excluded from the group but its June 30  
takeover of Hong Kong was clearly on the minds of the summit 
participants, worried over whether the British colony can retain 
its dynamic economy and political freedoms. 
	  The summit communique urged China to respect Hong Kong's  
different system by allowing democratic legislative elections to 
go ahead and to ``ensure its high degree of autonomy.'' 
	 The world leaders also discussed an item not on their final  
agenda -- what to with captured Cambodian Khmer Rouge leader Pol 
Pot, who is held responsible for the genocide of more than one 
million people after his forces took over the southeast Asian 
nation in 1975. 
	 U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Sunday the  
United States wanted to see Pol Pot brought before some form of 
international justice but did not elaborate. Cambodian leaders 
say they are asking the United Nations for help to bring Pol Pot 
before an international tribunal.
