Lott says the United States could be the first NATO country to 
ratify the enlargement of the Western alliance early next year. 
	 ``The United States will be one of the (first), if not the  
first, countries to act on ratification,'' the Mississippi 
Republican told reporters Thursday during a visit by a Senate 
delegation to Hungary, part of a tour of Western and Eastern 
Europe. 
	 Lott's comments came ahead of next week's North Atlantic  
Treaty Organization summit in Madrid at which Poland, Hungary 
and the Czech Republic are now sure to be invited to join. 
	 The 100-seat U.S. Senate will have to ratify any decision to  
expand NATO with a two-thirds majority. 
	 ``We expect to receive (the ratification documents) from the  
United States president some time in early February. I, as 
Senate majority leader, will move in concert with the Foreign 
Affairs Committee to schedule it as soon as possible,'' he said. 
	 The Clinton administration, which strongly backs bringing in  
new NATO members, has launched a political initiative to ensure 
it wins congressional backing for expansion despite vocal 
resistance from some conservative senators. 
	 Sen. Joseph Lieberman, accompanying Lott in Budapest, said  
those opposing NATO expansion on the grounds that it encouraged 
extremism in Russia had underestimated the significance of the 
Founding Act signed in May between NATO and Moscow clearing the 
way for enlargement. 
	 ``(Opponents) seem to be most focused on Russia, on the  
encouragement of nationalist and even militarist forces, but I 
believe the Founding Act ended that debate,'' the Connecticut 
Democrat said. 
	 ``It would be ironic if Americans were more concerned about  
Russia than the Russians themselves seem to be as evidenced by 
their signing of the Founding Act.'' 
	 Lieberman said he believed that if the ratification vote  
were taken now the Senate would easily have the necessary 
two-thirds majority, but he added the debate was only really 
beginning. 
	 ``Someone is sure to ask 'Are we prepared to send Americans  
in uniform to defend Budapest, Warsaw or Prague?' 
	 ``Our answer would be that we believe extending NATO is the  
best way to preserve stability in Europe and avoid the need ever 
to send troops here again.'' 
	 He estimated the cost to the United States of enlargement as  
$150 million to $200 million and described it as ``a very good 
investment.'' 
	 Lott said Hungarians were especially deserving of NATO  
membership as they had been among the first to resist oppression 
in the old Soviet-dominated Warsaw Pact. 
	 ``The earliest stirrings of freedom in the Warsaw Pact were  
in Hungary in 1956 when the Hungarians fought tanks with Molotov 
cocktails -- we remember that,'' he said, referring to the 
Hungarian popular uprising against Stalinism which was 
suppressed by the Soviet Army. 
	 ``(NATO membership) is not a gift to Hungary, this is  
something that Hungary has worked for and earned,'' he said.
