Friday as they tried to scale the walls of the Mexican embassy here 
during a demonstration against the slaughter of 45 indigenous 
Mexican Indians early this week. 
   Representatives of non-governmental organisations meanwhile  
delivered a written protest to the ambassador, holding the Mexican 
government "directly or indirectly" responsible for the massacre, in 
the predominantly Maya state of Chiapas, southern Mexico. 
   The protest note said that the government had helped "prepare,  
finance and recruit the paramilitary groups" which carried out the 
killings on Monday. 
   The Mexican interior ministry said on Thursday that the  
government "categorically rejects" charges that it played any part 
in the massacre of 21 women, nine men, 14 children and an infant -- 
all members of the indigenous Tzotzil Maya tribe. 
   In Paris on Friday, Danielle Mitterrand, widow of president  
Francois Mitterrand, led a group of prominent French people 
demanding that the Mexican authorities disband the paramilitaries. 
   Representatives of the group asked to be admitted to the Mexican  
embassy later in the day to deliver a note stating that "Mexico 
cannot maintain talk in Paris about democracy, human rights and 
peace while it allows death squads to sow terror with impunity in 
Chiapas."
