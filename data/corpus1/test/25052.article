Tuesday a Japanese Red Army guerrilla deported from Bolivia and 
wanted for attacks on U.S. and French missions as well as a 1977 
hijacking. 
	 A police spokesman said Jun Nishikawa was arrested at  
Tokyo's Narita airport on his arrival from Bolivia, where he was 
first detained. 
	 Nishikawa was deported from Bolivia after police there  
detained him last week on suspicion of being involved in attacks 
on the French embassy in the Hague in 1974 and on a U.S. 
diplomatic compound in Malaysia the following year. 
	 Nishikawa, who was on trial for attacks carried out in the  
Hague, had been on an international wanted list since his group 
stormed a U.S. diplomatic compound where he was being held in 
Kuala Lumpur in 1975 and succeeded in having him released. 
	 Nishikawa's arrest in Tokyo was for his suspected  
involvement with a 1977 hijacking case in which a five-member 
Japanese Red Army group hijacked a Japan Airlines flight from 
Paris to Tokyo, forcing it to land in Dhaka, Bangladesh. 
	 The group won the release of six colleagues from Japanese  
jails and $6 million in cash in exchange for the hostages. 
	 At the time, Japan came under severe international criticism  
for releasing the convicts and paying the ransom. 
	 Nishikawa, known as ``Tony,'' was captured last week in the  
tropical lowland city of Santa Cruz in a joint effort by 
Bolivian and Peruvian intelligence agencies using data from the 
international police agency Interpol. 
	 Japanese police say about 20 members of the ageing Japanese  
Red Army under its leader Fusako Shigenobu, a 51-year-old woman, 
run a guerrilla training camp in Lebanon's Bekaa valley. 
	 In February, five Japanese Red Army members were arrested in  
Beirut and charged with using false passports. Japan sought 
their extradition but Lebanon decided to put them on trial.
