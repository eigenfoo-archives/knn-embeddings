Richard Holbrooke, Monday had warm words for Turkish Prime 
Minister Mesut Yilmaz as tension rose between old rivals Greece 
and Turkey over the divided Mediterranean island. 
	 Greece accused Turkish warplanes of buzzing a military  
transport plane taking the defense minister to Cyprus, and said 
Greek fighters had intercepted them. But the Turkish foreign 
ministry denied the incident had taken place. 
	 ``I was enormously impressed. He (Yilmaz) laid out his  
government's position with clarity,'' Holbrooke told reporters 
after talks with Yilmaz. 
	 ``I will be able to take a very positive view of the Turkish  
position to Washington when I report to Secretary (of State 
Madeleine) Albright and President Clinton,'' he said. 
	 Holbrooke, the architect of the Bosnian peace accord, is on  
his first visit to the region since his appointment earlier this 
year as Clinton's Cyprus point man. 
	 ``This trip is not a negotiating trip, because I'm not going  
to Nicosia or Athens. This is to discuss with the Turkish 
government their views on a variety of issues, primarily 
Cyprus,'' Holbrooke told reporters. 
	 Cyprus has been partitioned between the Turkish and Greek  
communities since 1974, when Turkey invaded in response to a 
coup engineered by the military junta then ruling Greece. Turkey 
maintains 30,000 troops on the north of the island. 
	 Tension has risen since the Greek Cypriot government  
announced it would buy anti-aircraft missiles from Russia. 
Turkey has threatened to use force to prevent the planned 
deployment of the missiles next year. 
	 Greece said Monday Turkish warplanes had buzzed a military  
transport plane carrying Greek Defense Minister Akis 
Tsohatzopoulos to Cyprus, fueling tension in the region. 
	 Greek journalists traveling with the minister reported that  
the Turkish F-16s appeared dangerously close to their plane. 
	 A Greek defense ministry official said the Turkish planes  
were intercepted by two Greek F-4 fighters taking part in a 
joint Greek-Cypriot military exercise on Cyprus. 
	 A Turkish foreign ministry spokesman denied the incident had  
taken place. 
	 Greece has accused Turkey of repeated violations of its air  
space in the last few days in reaction to the joint exercise, 
but Ankara has denied the accusations. 
	 Holbrooke, after meeting Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail  
Cem, said he did not think the exercises would lead to a crisis. 
``They are just training exercises,'' he said. 
	 ``I do not like anything which increases tension in the  
area. But my view clearly expressed is that military training 
exercises... I just think they are a waste of money and time, 
but that is a personal view,'' he said. 
	 Greece has sent aircraft and warships to Cyprus for a  
military exercise with the small Greek Cypriot armed forces. 
	 Asked about the timing of the exercise on Cyprus, Holbrooke  
said ``every year, everywhere it is always the wrong time.'' 
	 Turkey and Greece came close to war over uninhabited islets  
in the eastern Aegean last year. Conflict was narrowly avoided 
after U.S. mediation.
