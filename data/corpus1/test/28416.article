Street's overnight slump and moved higher on Friday, led by 
strong gains in Tokyo and Hong Kong. 
	 Indonesian stocks were up five percent in late trade.  
Dealers said the gains reflected regional strength and the 
government promise not to renew a ban on palm oil exports rather 
than enthusiasm for the revised reform package Jakarta signed 
with the International Monetary Fund on Thursday. 
	 The rupiah was little changed in thin trade at 8,350/8,650  
to the U.S. dollar with analysts calling for further evidence of 
the government's commitment to implement the reforms, which will 
hit the family of Indonesian President Suharto. 
	 Tokyo stocks ended 6.11 percent higher at 16,046.45 on hopes  
of further government steps to boost the domestic economy, 
fueling a rally in the yen to 128.63 to the U.S. dollar from 
130.18 earlier. 
	 ``The sentiment of the market is changing slightly. The  
market is showing more interest in unwinding long dollar 
positions,'' a spot dealer at a city bank in Tokyo said. 
	 U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers on Friday  
called on Tokyo to carry through on measures to restore domestic 
demand-led growth. 
	 Summers, speaking at the end of a whirlwind tour of Asian  
states, also said implementation of this week's new economic 
reform package was crucial for Indonesia, although he believed 
the situation in that country had stabilized since last week. 
	 Hong Kong also gained, shrugging off New York's 92-point  
slide as well as the domestic jitters that dragged blue-chips 
seven percent lower on Thursday after a week of bad news. 
	 The Hang Seng index ended the session 3.74 percent stronger  
at 8,900 after hitting a high of 9,044. 
	 Rumors that companies were suffering from debt management  
problems seemed to fade a little, prompting some short-covering. 
	 But dealers said the bounce may only be a temporary respite  
from the black clouds still gathered over Asia. 
	 ``We're still worried about credits around town,'' said one  
head trader. ``All these markets are very thin. There's a bit of 
a short-squeeze going on, but nothing really has changed.'' 
	 Volume was a paltry HK$8.5 billion in Hong Kong, reflecting  
a broad-based lack of interest in Asian stocks, he said. 
	 ``There have been so many redundancies, people are more  
worried about their jobs than the market,'' he said. 
	 On Thursday, Schroders Plc said it would ax 200 jobs in  
Asia, following the loss of 700 Hong Kong jobs from the 
liquidation of Peregrine Investment Holdings. 
	 BZW Asia laid off 75 people on Monday and Indosuez W.I. Carr  
Securities cut 72 jobs last month. 
	 The approach of Chinese New Year and Wall Street's holiday  
closure on Monday helped to keep trade lackluster throughout the 
rest of the region, dealers said. 
	 Elsewhere in Asia shares were mixed, with Manila pulling  
back while Bangkok, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur gained. The 
Malaysian ringgit, Philippine peso and Thai baht were flat to 
firmer. The Singapore dollar recovered from early losses to 
trade at 1.7465/15 against the U.S. dollar. 
	 In South Korea, the won pared early gains, trading at 1,614  
compared to 1,530 earlier while the Taiwan dollar continued to 
trade around the T$34 level. 
	 South Korean shares lost some momentum, ending 3.53 percent  
lower, with traders warning that the recent rally could soon run 
out of steam. The index is up more than 30 percent since the 
start of the year, with some major stocks reporting 100 percent 
gains.
