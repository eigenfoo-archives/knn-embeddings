Augusto Pinochet brushed aside violent and vociferous protests 
Wednesday to join the country's Senate as a lifelong, unelected 
legislator. 
	 The newly retired 82-year-old grandfather smiled as he was  
sworn into Chile's upper house of Congress, which is based in 
Valparaiso, a Pacific port 88 miles northwest of the capital, 
Santiago. 
	 Pinochet ruled Chile with an iron fist between 1973 and 1990  
after ousting socialist President Salvador Allende in a bloody 
coup. At least 3,000 people died or disappeared during his rule. 
Tens of thousands more fled the country rather than face the 
military government. 
	 Outside the Senate, some 500 anti-Pinochet activists burned  
an effigy of the general, who retired Tuesday as commander in 
chief of the army after 24 years, ending a 65-year military 
career. 
	 ``Assassin, assassin, assassin,'' opponents shouted at the  
gates of the heavily guarded Senate. 
	 Inside, Pinochet sat calmly at the back of the upper house  
in a dark suit and red tie. He was one of 30 new legislators 
sworn in en masse by Senate Chairman Sergio Romero. 
	 ``I formally declare that you all are now senators,'' Romero  
said. 
	 The chairman delayed the start of the session for 15 minutes  
because of anti-Pinochet protests inside the Senate. 
	 More than a dozen left-wing legislators brought in  
photographs of people who had been detained and who disappeared 
during Pinochet's 17-year rule. When Pinochet failed to win 50 
percent support in a 1988 plebiscite, he was obliged to yield to 
a civilian government. 
	 Only when the legislators removed the black-and-white  
pictures did Romero open the special session that marked the 
start of a new legislative period. 
	 A scuffle and pushing match broke out inside the Senate as  
right-wingers tried to clear the floor for the session to start. 
Pinochet, arms folded, occasionally smiling, ignored whistles, 
jeers and boos directed at him. 
	 On the streets outside, activists clashed with police,  
opening up barriers in an attempt to enter the Senate grounds. 
Police pushed them back, using shields and batons. Radio 
reported that several people were injured. 
	 At the rear of the Senate building, where the general  
entered to avoid the protests, about 50 admirers chanted, 
``Pinochet, Pinochet, we are here again at your side.'' 
	 Opponents of Pinochet say it makes a sham of Chile's  
democracy that he can join the Senate under rules of the 
Constitution he himself changed in 1980. Overnight, several 
hundred demonstrators, many of them students, lighted bonfires 
in the street and held banners while a drum was pounded in the 
background. 
	 ``It is impossible that democracy exists in a country when  
there are unelected senators,'' said Berta Manriquez, 49, whose 
husband was executed in 1973 in Pinochet's takeover. 
	 President Eduardo Frei's center-left coalition government  
has openly opposed Pinochet's decision to take up the unelected 
seat. But Frei's attempts to change the Constitution have so far 
been defeated in the Senate. 
	 Right-wingers, many close to Pinochet and other unelected  
senators unwilling to give up their status, have enough votes to 
block constitutional amendments. 
	 After the swearing-in ceremony, the 48-member upper house  
elected Andres Zaldivar, a member of the Christian Democrat 
Party and a close ally of Frei, its new chairman. 
	 Pinochet cast his first legislative vote, a sign he intends  
to be active in his new position. 
	 But Pinochet is not expected to play an important role in  
the Senate, political analysts and government officials have 
said. Close friends have said he may serve on a defense 
commission, maintaining a working relationship with his former 
army colleagues. 
	 And Pinochet could face problems in Congress. Sixteen  
legislators introduced a bill Tuesday asking the lower house to 
investigate Pinochet's purchase of properties during his time as 
commander in chief.
