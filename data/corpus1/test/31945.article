staged a peaceful protest in Kosovo province Sunday after a 
Catholic mass for those killed in a police crackdown last week. 
	 The demonstrators walked through the streets of the  
provincial capital Pristina, many of them holding pictures of 
the late Catholic nun Mother Theresa, who was of Albanian 
origin, and placards calling on the United States and European 
Union to help end the bloodshed. 
	 It was the third mass demonstration since the police  
operation against alleged Albanian separatist guerrillas in 
which at least 80 people died, including women and children. 
	 Many villagers in the Drenica area west of Pristina, a  
traditional nationalist stronghold, are still sealed off by 
police cordons and many villagers are living rough in the hills, 
too afraid to return to their homes. 
	 Belgrade has issued a third invitation to Albanian leaders  
for talks on Monday on the province's future. 
	 The Albanian side rejected two earlier invitations last week  
on the grounds that they did not include the option of 
independence for Kosovo, which all Albanian parties are 
demanding. 
	 The United States and its European allies are stepping up  
diplomatic pressure on both sides to open a dialogue on Kosovo's 
future, demanding something like the autonomy it once had before 
it was suspended by Belgrade in 1989. 
	 They have given Belgrade until March 25 to make some headway  
or face tough new financial sanctions, but will also urge 
Albanian leaders to drop their boycott of the talks, and demands 
for independence.
