	DENVER, Dec. 11 (UPI) -- The defense rested its case in the trial of  
Oklahoma City bombing defendant Terry Nichols, who could face the death 
penalty if convicted of the April 19, 1995, attack on the Alfred P. 
Murrah Federal Building. 
	The last witness to testify for the defense was Marife Nichols, who  
told jurors today that her husband admitted he lied about where he was 
going with Timothy McVeigh on Easter Sunday, three days before the 
attack. 
	Terry Nichols did not testify.  
	U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch told the seven-woman, five-man  
jury and six alternates, ``There won't be very much more.'' After two 
prosecution rebuttals, the judge sent them home for the weekend. 
	Closing arguments will be delivered Monday, followed by  
deliberations. The jury will not be sequestered through deliberations, 
as McVeigh jurors were, Matsch said. 
	The judge encouraged jurors to ``keep open minds,'' to avoid anyone  
who wants to talk about the case and warned them that his instructions 
next week ``will be quite detailed.'' 
	Trial observer and Denver attorney Scott Robinson said, ``The defense  
at times did a masterful job,'' but he said he doesn't think Michael 
Tigar achieved his goal of proving Nichols was not involved. 
	The 24-year-old Mrs. Nichols said, ``He told me he was lying to me  
about Omaha'' as she and her husband approached the Herington, Kan., 
police station to find out why news reports linked him to the bombing. 
	She testified that Nichols stepped away from Easter dinner to take a  
phone call and 15 minutes later headed out the door, explaining that 
McVeigh was having car trouble in Omaha, Neb. 
	The government says that was the day Nichols followed McVeigh to  
Oklahoma City, where the condemned bomber left his getaway car near the 
Murrah building. Three days later, the building was blown apart by a 
truck bomb and 168 people were killed. 
	Mrs. Nichols delivered testimony that clashed with the defense  
contention that her husband used a mask found in their home to frighten 
her as a joke. She said she had never seen the mask that prosecutors say 
Nichols wore when he robbed Arkansas gun dealer Roger Moore. 
	Under cross-examination Mrs. Nichols acknowledged knowing that her  
husband used aliases but said, ``I cannot remember which name he used at 
the gun shows. All these aliases sound familiar to me.'' 
	Evidence shows Nichols used several aliases to register at motels,  
rent storage units and buy a long distance calling card, from which the 
government developed much of its case. 
	Nichols may join McVeigh and 13 other federal prisoners facing  
execution, if he is convicted of eight first-degree murder counts and 
three bomb related charges. McVeigh was convicted and sentenced to die.
