Front coalition, Inder Kumar Gujral, said Sunday that President 
Shankar Dayal Sharma had named him the new prime minister. 
	 ``I'm grateful to Rashtrapatiji (president) that he has  
asked me to be prime minister,'' Gujral told reporters as he 
left the ornate presidential palace where he had met Sharma. 
	 Gujral said he would be sworn in at 10 a.m. Monday, and the  
president had asked him to prove his majority in the lower house 
of parliament, the Lok Sabha, Tuesday. 
	 Asked about the formation of a council of ministers, Gujral  
said: ``That I will decide tonight.'' 
	 Gujral was chosen Saturday as the new leader of the 15-party  
United Front coalition to replace caretaker Prime Minister H.D. 
Deve Gowda. 
	 Deve Gowda resigned on April 11 after losing a vote of  
confidence in the Lok Sabha which was triggered by the Congress 
party's decision to withdraw its vital support. 
	 Congress has pledged its support to Gujral.
