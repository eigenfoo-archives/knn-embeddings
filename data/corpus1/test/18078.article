Saturday that Amado Carrillo Fuentes, alleged to be Mexico's 
most notorious drug lord, was dead. 
	 Two Mexico City radio stations said the alleged leader of  
the powerful Juarez cocaine cartel had died and that what 
appeared to be mourners were gathered outside his mother's home 
in northwestern Sinaloa state. 
	 Carolina Nava, a spokeswoman for the Attorney General's  
Office, told Reuters she had heard reports of Carrillo's death 
but could not confirm them. 
	 Mexico City's Formato 21 radio station said the drug kingpin  
died during surgery, but did not specify what kind of operation 
he had undergone. It said his body was being flown to his home 
state of Sinaloa later in the day. 
	 The station gave no source for its report.  
	 Rival radio station Radio Red also broadcast a report that  
Carrillo had died. 
	 Carrillo, believed to be 42, has been accused by Mexican and  
U.S. officials of transporting billions of dollars worth of 
cocaine into the United States from his base in Ciudad Juarez, 
on the Mexico-U.S. border. 
	 Thomas Constantine, the head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement  
Administration (DEA), described Carrillo in June 1996 as ``the 
most powerful figure in the Mexican drug trade''. 
	 Efforts by Mexican authorities to catch Carrillo, the  
subject of at least 26 separate DEA investigations, have so far 
proven fruitless and he has been a fugutive for the last eight 
years. 
	 Carrillo's power grew during the late 1980s and has since  
become almost legendary. He earned the nickname ``Lord of the 
Skies'' for his ability to fly cocaine-laden planes undetected 
from South America to Mexico. 
	 Mexico's former anti-drugs chief, Gen. Jesus Gutierrez  
Rebollo, was thrown in jail in February on charges he had 
received bribes from Carrillo. 
	 Carrillo narrowly escaped capture in January this year when  
soldiers and police stormed his sisters' wedding in Sinaloa. An 
army major was later arrested for having allegedly tipped off 
the drug lord and allowing him to escape.
