Kofi Annan Monday hailed President Laurent Kabila for ending 
despotic rule in the former Zaire, and called on him to protect 
refugees and secure the rule of law in his renamed Democratic 
Republic of Congo. 
	 In his first address to an Organization of African Unity  
(OAU) summit since he was elected last year as the U.N.'s first 
leader from a sub-Saharan nation, Ghanaian Annan said Kabila, 
whose seven-month rebel campaign drove former president Mobutu 
Sese Seko from power last month, had a historic opportunity to 
set his country on a new path. 
	 ``A long period of despotic rule has been brought to an end,  
and a truly historic opportunity beckons,'' he said of Mobutu, 
whose 32-year-old regime was regarded by many as one of the 
continent's most repressive and corrupt. 
	 ``We welcome President Kabila's commitment to constitutional  
rule and to the holding of democratic elections,'' Annan said. 
	 The U.N. Security Council, alarmed by reports of massacres  
of Rwandan Hutu refugees, Thursday called for an immediate end 
to violence against the exiles in Kabila's Congo. 
	 The refugees are remnants of more than one million Hutus who  
fled Rwanda in 1994 to escape reprisals for the genocide of an 
estimated 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus. 
	 Investigators have so far been refused access to suspected  
mass graves by Kabila's Tutsi-dominated army. 
	 Annan told Kabila in his address to the OAU summit that it  
was not too late to handle the refugee problem in a humane 
manner. 
	 In Kinshasa, a cabinet minister said there was no evidence  
Rwandan Hutu refugees were being massacred in Congo. 
	 ``Whether it is an official of the United Nations or whoever  
that makes these allegations they should not be made lightly and 
without verification,'' Information Minister Raphael Ghenda told 
Reuters when asked about Annan's statement. 
	 ``The word massacre no longer carries the weight it once  
did, and for anybody to make allegations without evidence is 
pure and simple irresponsibility,'' Ghenda said. 
	 Annan said, ``It is necessary even now that the protection  
of human life, the full respect of human life, is given the 
highest priority and that the rule of law should quickly return 
to that country .... 
	 ``The U.N. asks that we may tend to the weak and to the  
displaced so that this new beginning may be an acclamation and 
affirmation of the sanctity of life.'' 
	 Annan is expected to meet Kabila on the sidelines of the OAU  
summit that ends Wednesday.
