resignation of Pakistan's chief justice forced the adjournment 
of a contempt-of-court hearing against Prime Minister Nawaz 
Sharif Friday. 
	 Witnesses said the session was brought to an abrupt close  
when some demonstrators managed to get inside the Supreme Court 
building where Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah was presiding over 
the unprecedented hearing of contempt charges against Sharif. 
	 There was no immediate indication when the hearing, which  
could in theory force Sharif to stand down if he is found 
guilty, might resume. 
	 S.M. Zafar, Sharif's lawyer, strongly condemned the incident  
as serving neither democracy nor the constitution. 
	 ``They (demonstrators) have disturbed a peaceful proceeding  
in the court where relevant issues were being debated,'' he told 
reporters after the court was adjourned. 
	 ``Such persons would harm the country's fragile democracy  
and should be dealt with strictly by law enforcement agencies.'' 
	 Witnesses said the demonstrators were supporters of Sharif's  
Muslim League party, which has been at loggerheads with Shah and 
the judiciary for weeks in a power struggle that has virtually 
paralyzed political life. 
	 They gathered outside the white marble building before the  
session resumed, chanting slogans demanding that the chief 
justice step down after he was suspended by two regional courts. 
	 The courts in Quetta and Peshawar upheld petitions claiming  
that Shah was not the most senior judge when elevated to the 
post in 1994. 
	 But the Supreme Court on Thursday overturned the rulings by  
a vote of four judges to one. 
	 In Karachi, Muslim League lawyers on Friday tried to file a  
petition against the chief justice at the court's Sindh province 
bench, but arrived there after the court had closed. 
	 Friday's protest left the contempt charges against Sharif  
unresolved, but political sources said that behind the scenes 
discussions among the judiciary, President Farooq Leghari, 
Sharif and the army were nearing a solution. 
	 Sharif is being sued for contempt over remarks he made that  
were critical of a court decision. He has said he respects the 
judiciary but has not made an outright apology. 
	 The Supreme Court and Sharif are also at odds over  
legislation. It has suspended a constitutional amendment that 
Sharif brought in soon after taking power in elections nine 
months ago that outlawed the practice of members of parliament 
changing sides. 
	 The court is also hearing a petition to suspend a Sharif  
amendment stripping the president of the power to sack 
governments. 
	 Sharif has refused to back down in his confrontation with  
the judiciary and has asserted that parliament has the supreme 
legislative power. 
	 The controversy has brought warnings of constitutional  
chaos, unnerved the stock market and dominated politics. 
	 The Karachi stock exchange, which has see-sawed on every  
development, was closed for a holiday on Friday. But money 
market dealers said the row was still a market factor.
