sharp warning to China against invading Taiwan, and the House of 
Representatives approved a resolution stating that Washington 
should help defend Taiwan in such an attack. 
	 A senior U.S. official also said Taiwan had asked the United  
States in day-long talks here to provide diesel submarines to 
Taipei for naval defense, a request rejected by Washington last 
year. 
	 The official, who asked not to be identified, said the  
request came in annual talks on possible new arms sales to 
Taipei as tension grew over Chinese maneuvers off the island in 
advance of Taiwan's presidential elections on Saturday. 
	 The Pentagon Tuesday put China on notice that ``America has  
the best damned Navy in the world'' and could sail the Taiwan 
Strait if it chose to, but the State Department hastened to say 
this was not meant to provoke Beijing. 
	 The defense resolution, overwhelmingly passed by the House  
despite White House opposition, is not binding on the Clinton 
administration. It was drafted in response to Chinese military 
exercises n the Taiwan Strait. 
	 ``America has the best damned Navy in the world, and no one  
should ever forget that,'' said Defense Secretary William Perry 
in an obvious warning to Beijing not to launch an attack on 
Taiwan. 
	 ``Beijing should know -- and this (a gathering U.S. armada)  
will remind them -- that, while they are a great military power, 
that the premier, the strongest military power, in the western 
Pacific is the United States,'' Perry said in a speech to 
current and former members of Congress. 
	 He referred to a U.S. naval task force gathering in the  
Taiwan region -- although well away from the strait separating 
China from what it regards as its renegade province -- to be 
centered around two aircraft carriers. 
	 At the State Department, where a reporter asked about the  
apparent escalation in rhetoric, spokesman Glyn Davies said 
there was no such intention on the U.S. side. 
	 Davies said Perry's comments were ``about his pride in the  
United States armed forces and the United States Navy.'' 
	 ``That was just a statement of fact, that it is the best  
navy in the world. But there's no racheting up here, from our 
standpoint, of the rhetoric at all.'' 
	 At a separate Pentagon briefing, however, Defense spokesman  
Ken Bacon noted that the carrier Nimitz would arrive off Taiwan 
on Saturday or Sunday to join the carrier Independence -- and he 
he rejected China's warning against sending U.S. warships 
through the Taiwan Strait. 
	 ``We reserve the right to sail in international waters,''  
Bacon said. ``Whether or not we sail through the Strait of 
Taiwan has not been decided.'' 
	 The United States and China, meanwhile, took steps that  
might help ease tensions, although not immediately. 
	 In Prague, where Secretary of State Warren Christopher was  
traveling, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said 
Christopher would meet his Chinese counterpart, Qian Qichen, in 
The Hague on April 21 to discuss Taiwan and other issues. 
	 At the Pentagon, Bacon said Chinese Defense Minister Chi  
Haotian was scheduled to visit for talks with Perry sometime in 
April. 
	 U.S. officials refused to characterize the tone of the  
one-day arms meeting between Taiwan officials and 
representatives of the Defense and State Departments. And they 
would not say when any decision could come out of the talks. 
	 The Washington Times reported Tuesday that Taiwan wanted six  
German-designed diesel submarines to be built in the United 
States as well as new P-3 anti-submarine aircraft and 
air-launched Harpoon anti-ship missiles. 
	 But the senior U.S. official told Reuters that Taiwan  
officials did not ask for the anti-submarine planes or the 
missiles.
