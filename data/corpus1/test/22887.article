Italy Sunday, causing further damage to buildings in the region 
already shaken by a series of temblors over the past three weeks, 
Italian officials said. 
   No casualties were immediately reported, civil protection  
workers said. 
   The Italian Geophysical Institute in Rome said the first  
earthquake struck at 1:08 p.m. (1108 GMT) with a magnitude of 4.6 on 
the Richter scale and an epicentre in the mountainous Colfiorito 
region around 150 kilometres (100 miles) north of the capital. 
   Two weaker aftershocks rolled through with the following 20  
minutes, the institute said. 
   The French National Seismological Network in Strasbourg said it  
had recorded the first tremblor at 5.2 on the scale. 
   Council officials in the town of Foligno, in the province of  
Umbria, said the medieval tower of its palace -- already damaged by 
a quake on Tuesday -- had suffered fresh damage. 
   Firemen in the town said a house had also collapsed there, after  
being evacuated. 
   Giorgio Croci, an official in charge of repairing damage to the  
historic Saint Francis basilica in nearby Assisi, said the building 
had escaped further harm. Two earthquakes on September 26 had caused 
serious damage to the basilica which again suffered through 
Tuesday's quake. 
   The September 26 quakes -- the strongest yet recorded in the  
region -- caused the deaths of 12 people and resulted in millions of 
dollars in damage. Some 40,000 people saw their homes destroyed or 
damaged. 
   More than 100 aftershocks have been reported since, prompting  
many to spend the nights outdoors. 
   Thousands of people are meanwhile living in temporary  
accommodation, including welfare centres, caravans and tents, having 
fled their wrecked or badly-damaged homes.
