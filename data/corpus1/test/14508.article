a recently freed leader of the Islamic group Hamas that claimed 
responsibility for a suicide bombing that killed three women in 
a Tel Aviv cafe, a Hamas source said Saturday. 
	 In fresh violence, hundreds of Palestinian youths shouting  
``God is greatest'' threw petrol bombs and rocks at Israeli 
soldiers who responded with rubber bullets and teargas in the 
West Bank town of Hebron. 
	 Hospital officials said at least 15 Arab protesters were  
injured by rubber bullets. The clashes followed similar violence 
in Hebron Friday along what is becoming a confrontation line 
dividing the Israeli and PLO-controlled parts of the city. 
	 In Gaza, a Hamas source who declined to be identified said  
Ibrahim al-Makadmeh, a leader of a military wing of the group, 
was rearrested late Friday. 
	 Makadmeh, who Palestinian President Yasser Arafat released  
>from  jail this week, told a rally Friday after the suicide 
attack during the Jewish costume holiday of Purim that only 
bombs could stop Israel's settlement drive. 
	 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had accused Arafat  
of tacitly giving Hamas a ``green light'' to strike against the 
Jewish state by freeing Makadmeh and other militants arrested 
last year after suicide bombers killed 59 people in Israel. 
	 An anonymous telephone caller told police Hamas carried out  
the Tel Aviv bombing, three days after Israel broke ground for a 
Jewish settlement at Jabal Abu Ghneim, or Har Homa, in Arab East 
Jerusalem. 
	 Before the news of Makadmeh's detention, Netanyahu's  
communications director David Bar-Illan called on the PLO to 
crack down on Islamic fundamentalist groups such as Hamas. 
	 ``The peace process is in jeopardy at this point. If the  
Palestinians do not do what we are asking them to do by way of 
fighting terrorism it is very doubtful that the process can 
continue,'' Bar-Illan told Reuters. 
	 Arafat condemned Friday's blast, which also wounded 42  
people, and telephoned Netanyahu to express condolences. Israel 
clamped a closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
	 Ami Ayalon, Israel's Shin Bet secret police head, held talks  
at an undisclosed location in Tel Aviv late Friday with Mohammad 
Dahlan, the Palestinian security chief in Gaza, and another 
Palestinian security official, Mohammad Jibril Rajoub. 
	 ``We are telling them (the Palestinians) they must  
co-operate in combating terrorism,'' Bar-Illan said. 
	 Palestinian sources identified the bomber as Mousa  
Abdel-Qader Ghneimat, 28, from the Israeli-controlled West Bank 
village of Sourif. Israel clamped a curfew on Sourif and Voice 
of Palestine Radio said the Israeli army sealed his house. 
	 ``We will continue to fight violence and will continue to  
preserve security and stability,'' Dahlan said Friday. 
	 ``But Israel has to understand that for security measures to  
succeed there must be peace and the right environment has to 
prevail.'' 
	 Palestinians have accused Netanyahu of fomenting unrest by  
forging ahead with the Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem. 
	 At the United Nations Friday, the United States cast its  
second veto in two weeks to kill a Security Council resolution 
demanding that Israel halt work on the plan to build 6,500 homes 
for Jews at the site. 
	 In Washington, U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross said  
Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts had weathered shocks such as 
suicide bombings in the past. 
	 ``This is a process that has experienced a lot and somehow  
it has endured,'' he told CNN.
