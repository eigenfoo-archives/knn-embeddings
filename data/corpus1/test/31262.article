broad agreement Monday on a resolution warning Iraq of 
``severest consequences'' if it again barred U.N. weapons 
inspectors from suspected sites. 
	 Britain's ambassador Sir John Weston said final  
consultations would be held about 5 p.m. EST followed by a 
formal meeting at which they were expected to take a vote. All 
15 council members were expected to speak before the vote. 
	 The draft, sponsored by Britain and Japan, stops short of  
authorizing any use of force in a future standoff between U.N. 
inspectors and Iraq. 
	 It also partially meets concerns by France, Russia, China  
and other council members that any resort to military force 
would first require council approval. 
	 The compromise language says that the council would decide  
''in accordance with its responsibility under the U.N. Charter, 
to remain actively seized of the matter in order to ensure 
implementation of this resolution and to secure peace and 
security in the area.'' 
	 The resolution also endorses the agreement that  
Secretary-General Kofi Annan brought back from Baghdad a week 
ago providing access to ``presidential sites,'' which had 
previously been barred to U.N. weapons inspectors. 
	 France, Russia and China had organized the majority of the  
15-member council against the original British draft, backed by 
the United States. All five countries are permanent council 
members with veto powers. 
	 The United States has said it does not need specific  
authorization for a military strike but council discussions over 
the last week showed it was isolated in taking this legal 
position. 
	 Both the United States and Britain are maintaining a large  
force in the Gulf despite the apparent winding down of the 
crisis sparked by Iraq's refusal to grant U.N. inspectors access 
to the ``presidential sites,'' which contain President Saddam 
Hussein's palaces and well as other buildings. 
	 China and Russia have also said a resolution is not  
necessary because Annan's agreement, which averted a U.S.-led 
military strike, has legal authority on its own and does not 
need to be embedded in a new document. 
	 But Britain and the United States want to make sure anything  
done by Annan is also approved by the council. Otherwise, they 
fear Iraq may exploit two parallel tracks of negotiations, 
diplomats said. 
	 Annan's agreement with Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tareq  
Aziz sets up special procedures for U.N. arms inspectors 
searching in the eight ``presidential sites'' that would include 
diplomatic chaperons for the inspectors. 
	 This group is headed by a new commissioner, Jayantha  
Dhanapala, the Sri Lankan U.N. undersecretary-general for 
disarmament. His reports would go to Richard Butler, chairman of 
the U.N. Special Commission in charge of disarmament, and then 
to Annan, before reaching the council. 
	 In an inducement to Iraq, the draft resolution also  
reiterates the council's intention to consider lifting sanctions 
-- mainly a ban on oil sales -- once it was agrees Iraq has 
completed all the disarmament requirements contained in a 1991 
Gulf War cease-fire resolution. 
	 The sanctions were imposed when Iraq invaded Kuwait in  
August 1990.
