thousands on Wednesday on the eve of presidential polls to hear 
candidates deliver last-minute pledges to rescue the 
debt-riddled country. 
	 The three main hopefuls took to the streets around the  
capital early in the day, throwing themselves into the 
time-honoured election routine of kissing babies and campaigning 
through loudhailers. 
	 ``If I am elected tomorrow, I will immediately call Bill  
Clinton or (Japanese Prime Minister) Ryutaro Hashimoto to 
discuss Korea's economic problems,'' veteran opposition leader 
Kim Dae-jung told the crowd in an impromptu speech at a 
neighbourhood market. 
	 But election fever has come late to South Korea after a  
low-key campaign marked by the gloom and perceived humiliation 
of the crumbling economy's near $60 billion dollar rescue by the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF). 
	 Nevertheless, candidates took full advantage of the final  
hours before the vote to show that they were the ones the people 
could trust to reverse the country's catastrophic decline. 
	 Lee Hoi-chang of the governing Grand National Party met  
garbage collectors before the sun came up, then moved on to the 
open-air Namdaemun, or South Gate Market. 
	 Along the way, he ate a bowl of ``haejangkuk'' or blood and  
intestine soup, a traditional Korean hangover cure. 
	 Kim, who leads the National Congress for New Politics,  
addressed thousands at a midday speech at Chongryang-ri rail 
station, before moving on to Dongdaemun, the East Gate Market. 
	 Lee and Kim were believed to be neck-and-neck heading into  
Thursday's vote, but the publication of poll results has been 
banned since the campaign officially began on November 26. 
	 The third main candidate, Rhee In-je of the New Party by the  
People ensured the traditional neighbourhood markets of the 
capital heard his message by starting his final day at midnight 
on Tuesday. 
	 By mid-afternoon, the former provincial governor was  
standing in an open-topped vehicle in the crowded shopping 
district of Myong-dong. He waved and smiled as the vehicle made 
its way down the district's main thoroughfare. 
	 Earlier, Rhee's supporters, angered by media reports that  
Rhee had no chance to win, blocked some trucks carrying 
Wednesday editions of the leading Chosun Ilbo newspaper. The 
newspaper reported some deliveries had been disrupted. 
	 South Korean financial markets were calm on Wednesday after  
strong rallies earlier this week in anticipation of the election 
and a meeting of the IMF in Washington on Thursday. 
	 The IMF was scheduled to review the country's progress in  
implementing its rescue programme before releasing another $3.6 
billion in bail-out loans. 
	 Public comments by several IMF officials, including managing  
director Michel Camdessus, have indicated the fund would approve 
the release of the second tranche. 
	 But back in Seoul, about 35 members of the militant Korea  
Confederation of Trade Unions rallied near the U.S. Embassy on 
Wednesday and presented a letter to the U.S. government and the 
IMF questioning the motives behind the record bail-out. 
	 It said Koreans were ``unable to shake off the fear and  
suspicion that the IMF package represents those interests which 
may be intent on driving the Korean economy to a total collapse 
in order to establish a dominant position in Korea.'' 
	 The composite stock index closed up 3.52 percent to 418.49  
points. The won closed at 1,481 against the dollar, compared to 
Tuesday's close of 1,425, because of an early rush of import 
settlements. 
	 Brokers said some pro-government institutions went on a  
buying binge in late afternoon to give the embattled stock index 
one final shot in the arm ahead of Thursday's vote. 
	 ``Institutions linked to the ruling Grand National Party  
bought shares heavily towards the close,'' said one broker. 
	 Others said investors had hopes for the next president.  
	 ``Whoever takes office, it will be better than under the  
current government,'' said a Daishin Securities broker. 
	 Dealers said there was still upside for the U.S. unit  
because South Korea remained short of dollars and external debt 
obligations were coming due towards the year-end. 
	 ``There's a strong potential dollar demand, and I expect a  
rush of buy orders to come in once the financial instability 
surfaces again,'' said a dealer at a foreign bank. 
	 Thursday is a market holiday because of the election.
