bombing defendant Timothy McVeigh Thursday of being a right-wing 
extremist who thought the deadly blast would trigger a second 
American Revolution. 
	 But McVeigh's attorney, Stephen Jones, sought to counter the  
government's claim by saying he would prove it had accused the 
wrong man of blowing up the Alfred P. Murrah federal building 
and killing 168 people on April 19, 1995. 
	 In an opening statement laying out the case against the Gulf  
War veteran, prosecutor Joseph Hartzler declared: ``McVeigh 
liked to consider himself a patriot, someone who could start the 
second American Revolution. 
	 ``Our forefathers did not fight innocent women and  
children,'' he said.''They didn't plant bombs and run away 
wearing earplugs.'' 
	 McVeigh, who has pleaded innocent and who could face the  
death penalty if convicted, took copious notes during the 
opening statements, occasionally looking grim-faced and tense. 
	 Hartzler said the prosecution would offer evidence that  
McVeigh created a file in his sister Jennifer's computer that 
talked about Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms agents. 
	 ``It said all you tyrannical motherf------ will swing in the  
wind one day for your treasonous actions against the 
Constitution and the United States ... die you spineless, 
cowardice bastards,'' Hartzler said, reading from the computer 
entry. 
	 Hartzler also said surveillance tapes existed showing  
McVeigh's co-defendant Terry Nichols' truck in Oklahoma City on 
the Sunday before the bombing. The following day McVeigh was 
captured by a security camera at a McDonald's restaurant in 
Junction City, hours before he allegedly rented the Ryder truck. 
	 Jones said a witness who saw a man get out of the rented  
Ryder truck used in the bombing described him as short, stocky 
and of olive complexion. McVeigh is tall and fair-skinned. 
	 Jones called into question the eyewitness descriptions  
offered by employees at Elliott's Body Shop in Junction City, 
Kansas, where McVeigh allegedly rented the truck. Jones said 
they may have confused two other men who rented a similar truck 
the following day. 
	 Jones also claimed the evidence collected by authorities was  
handled improperly. ``They contaminated it, mishandled it, 
abused it, manipulated it and engaged in forensic 
prostitution.'' 
	 The government is expected to introduce evidence about bomb  
residue on McVeigh's clothing. But Jones countered: ``If Tim 
McVeigh had set that bomb, his fingernails, his nostrils, his 
hair, his clothing, his car, his shoes, and his socks would have 
it all over them and they don't. 
	 ``Every pancake has two sides,'' he said at the end of a two  
hour and 40 minute address to the jurors. 
	 Hartzler portrayed McVeigh as a twisted patriot out to  
avenge the 1993 FBI assault on the Branch Davidian religious 
cult in Waco, Texas, which ended in the deaths of 80 people. 
	 He said that prosecutors would present telephone records  
that trace McVeigh's activities from the time he allegedly 
sought to buy bomb-making materials in the fall of 1994 until 
the bombing. 
	 But Jones told the jurors the phone cards could be used by  
anyone who knew the password of the account. ``The card didn't 
carry a camera with it,'' Jones said. 
	 After sending jurors home early for the day because of snowy  
weather, Federal Judge Richard Matsch ruled that some 
prosecution photographs will be admitted as evidence over 
defense objections, including a photograph of the day-care 
center and another ``even though it shows blood and trauma.''
