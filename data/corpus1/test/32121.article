passengers and crew crashed into the sea Wednesday off northwestern 
Taiwan and officials said there was little hope of finding 
survivors. 
   Lin Chien-chiang, a city councilor from Hsinchu, told state-run  
television that two bodies had been found by fishermen. The report 
could not be independently confirmed. 
   Lin said fishermen in the area heard an explosion around the  
time of the crash. 
   State television said that military radar had located the  
wreckage of the plane. Formosa Airlines President Sun Hung-hsiang 
told the press the chances of finding survivors were slim. 
   Eight marine police boats were trying to find wreckage but  
helicopters were forced to return to base due to bad weather, 
Hsinchu airport director Chen Hua-shuo said. 
   The military also joined the search sending two frigates, a  
rescue boat, a C-130 transport aircraft and a S-70C helicopter to 
the crash site. 
   Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) official Yang Cheng-chih  
said the plane disappeared from radar screens a few minutes after 
taking off from Hsinchu at 7.30 pm (1130 GMT). The plane, bound for 
the southern city of Kaohsiung, crashed in the sea six miles off 
Hsinchu at 7:48 p.m. 
   CAA Director Tsai Tui has ordered the airline to ground six  
other SAAB airliners for comprehensive safety checks. 
   The crash occurred only three days after the air route was  
opened in response to rising demand. There were no foreigners on 
board the 36-seat Saab 340 airliner, which carried eight passengers 
and five crew. 
   Premier Vincent Siew expressed shock at the crash. The  
transportation and communications ministry formed a task force to 
handle the airline's second accident in seven months. 
   Formosa Airlines has the worst flight safety record of local  
airlines with six major air disasters over the last 10 years, 
reports here said. 
   Last August 10 one of its planes flew into a hill on the island  
of Matsu during heavy rain, killing 16 people. A weatherman 
responsible for keeping the island's airport open in bad weather 
later attempted to commit suicide  believing he was responsible. 
   "I could not sleep at the thought of the 16 deaths. I prefer to  
die," Ouyang Kangyen said in a suicide note. He has only just 
recovered from his injuries. 
   Formosa Airlines was left with six SAAB 340 and 10 other  
aircraft of other types after the tragedy, a Central News Agency 
report said. 
   With 678 staff, the airline suffered a 20 million Taiwan dollars  
after-tax loss in 1996, the report said. The carrier was established 
in 1955 to carry out crop-spraying missions and began to offer 
commercial flights in the early 1990s at the time of a major 
expansion in Taiwanese civil aviation. 
   Taiwan is still reeling from its worst air disaster on February  
16, when a China Airlines Airbus ploughed into houses outside Chiang 
Kai-shek International Airport. Some 182 passengers and 14 crew were 
killed as well as six people on the ground. 
   Two pilots were killed after an army twin-seat Th-55 trainer  
plane crashed in southern Taiwan Tuesday. 
   The government ordered flag carrier China Airlines to carry out  
a widespread staff shake-up after the February disaster. The Civil 
Aeronautics Administration announced the creation of a special task 
force to direct and supervise reforms.
