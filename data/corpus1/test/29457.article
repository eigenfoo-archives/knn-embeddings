outright Gulf Arab permission to use land-based military 
facilities in any attack on Iraq but it already has enough 
firepower afloat to do the job, analysts said on Tuesday. 
	 Most American airborne weaponry in the region is based in  
Saudi Arabia, where U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 
was unable in six hours of talks with Crown Prince Abdullah on 
Monday to gain permission to use the kingdom's bases. 
	 Albright, winding up a whirlwind tour of Kuwait, Saudi  
Arabia and Bahrain, expressed confidence on Tuesday that the 
United States would have ``all the cooperation we need across 
the board'' from Gulf states in the event military action 
against Iraq over the arms inspections crisis became necessary. 
	 She would not comment on specifics or operational details.  
U.S. diplomats said U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen would 
begin a three-day tour of Gulf Arab states on Sunday. 
	 But analysts said the United States already had enough  
firepower in the Gulf aboard two of the world's largest aircraft 
carriers, with a third about to enter the strategic waterway, 
and a British carrier also present in a show of solidarity. 
	 ``Our assessment is that the assets that they were seeking  
in the Gulf were desirable but not essential,'' said John 
Chipman of the International Institute for Strategic Studies 
(IISS). 
	 ``Naturally, military planners prefer the greatest variety  
of use of military force for an operation which might take on a 
fairly large scale, but in order to hit the variety of 
installations they might consider hitting, they can probably 
rely on carrier-based aircraft, cruise missiles and the like. 
	 ``But they would have preferred, I am certain, to have been  
able to rely on aircraft based in Incirlik in Turkey and also to 
be able to deploy aircraft from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait,'' he 
said. 
	 Even if permission to fly U.S. missions from bases in those  
countries was refused, a basic operation against Iraq could 
still be carried out successfully, said Chipman, director of the 
London-based IISS. 
	 The nuclear-powered carriers Nimitz and George Washington  
are loaded with 108 combat aircraft capable of hitting targets 
at 1,000 miles (1,600 km) range with high-technology weapons. 
	 Two submarines and surface warships in the carrier battle  
groups are armed with cruise missiles, though analysts say the 
impact of such weapons in the 1991 Gulf War was overstated. 
	 ``In the Gulf War something like 92 percent of munitions  
dropped were dumb, not smart bombs. So an awful lot more was 
done with old-fashioned type of munitions than people at the 
time chose to display,'' Chipman said. 
	 Only Kuwait, the tiny oil state whose 1990 invasion by Iraq  
triggered the Gulf War, has agreed in principle to back armed 
action if necessary in the rapidly escalating Iraq crisis. 
	 Among the U.S. military assets in Kuwait are six F-117  
stealth fighters -- small bombers that fly slower than the speed 
of sound to evade radar. The angular, all-black aircraft dropped 
laser-guided bombs on Baghdad during the Gulf War. 
	 Other U.S. allies in the region are reluctant to be seen  
openly to support an attack because of fears of a domestic 
backlash if Iraqi civilians are killed or wounded. 
	 ``Conventional wisdom is that, particularly in the context  
of an Arab-Israeli peace process that seems to be going nowhere 
except possibly backward, publicly the Gulf Arabs are very 
unkeen to demonstrate total and unfettered politico-military 
solidarity with a United States that does not seem to be 
pressuring Israel to the degree that they would prefer,'' 
Chipman said. 
	 But their attitude was somewhat schizophrenic, since in  
private many of them might sanction an operation which had as 
its aim the toppling of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. 
	 Anything which had a more modest aim -- to punish the Iraqi  
leader and force him to comply with arms inspectors -- might 
leave him more powerful, and therefore the Gulf Arabs would not 
want to be associated with it. 
	 ``It is clear that neither the United States nor the United  
Kingdom have as their stated or unstated objective in this the 
overthrow of Saddam Hussein,'' Chipman said. 
	 ``They don't have a plan B if that were to happen, and their  
intention is uniquely to weaken his support base so that he 
realizes that compliance with the inspection regime is better 
than non-compliance. But they can't be assured of that.'' 
	 The worst possible outcome would be that military strikes  
over a three or four day period hit a variety of installations, 
including some in which Saddam had placed human shields, and 
that he would then display dead women and children, Chipman 
said. 
	 The Iraqi leader could then say that ``imperialistic  
aggression'' was so serious that he refused to cooperate with 
the inspectors and they would have to depart for good, leaving 
Saddam with an uninspected program of biological and chemical 
weapons, he said.
