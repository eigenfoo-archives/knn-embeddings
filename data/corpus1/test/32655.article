held four hours of talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
Friday without discussing the scope of a promised Israeli 
pullback in the West Bank, an Israeli government official said. 
	 ``We didn't deal today with the matter of percentages and  
numbers. The government has still not decided on this,'' Israeli 
cabinet secretary Danny Naveh told Channel Two television. 
	 He described the talks as ``serious'' but declined to give  
details. 
	 Neither Ross, warned by Israel not to dictate a peace deal,  
nor Netanyahu, under pressure from hardliners in his government 
not to relinquish more territory, made any comment to reporters 
before or after the meeting at the prime minister's office. 
	 Ross had been widely expected to present U.S. proposals that  
reports said called for an Israeli pullback from 13.1 percent of 
the West Bank in return for Palestinian steps to fight Muslim 
militant violence. 
	 Ross later met Palestinian President Yasser Arafat in the  
West Bank town of Ramallah. 
	 Israeli political sources said the two men would meet again  
late Saturday. 
	 Israel's cabinet last Sunday termed the reported percentage  
``unacceptable.'' Netanyahu has said the United States itself 
had made a written pledge that Israel alone would decide how 
much land to cede. 
	 Briefing reporters in Washington Thursday, U.S. State  
Department spokesman James Rubin indicated Washington might be 
open to a compromise floated by Netanyahu to offer  Palestinians 
more continuous land -- ``quality'' areas -- in place of larger 
but disconnected bits of territory. 
	 ``For those of you who have followed this process, you have  
heard us say that in order to achieve a successful further 
redeployment, its got to talk about quantity, quality, timing 
and security, and that all of those fit together,'' Rubin said. 
	 ``The better the quality, perhaps the less the quantity.''  
	 Before Ross arrived, Netanyahu took a tough line on a West  
Bank troop withdrawal, saying: ``I can't accept a dictate. We 
have our principles. We're not deceiving anyone, not ourselves, 
not the voters, not the Palestinians and not the Americans. 
	 ``It's not my intention to prevent them (the United States)  
from raising ideas, only that they raise the right ideas,'' he 
told Israel radio. 
	 Arafat, asked in the West Bank town of Ramallah if he  
thought Ross would succeed in advancing the process, told 
reporters: ``I don't think so.'' 
	 In addition to a West Bank pullback, the U.S. plan is  
reported to propose an Israeli ``time-out'' to Jewish settlement 
expansion in occupied areas. 
	 The U.S. proposal is also reported to call on Arafat to meet  
a number of his peace pledges, including moves against Islamic 
militants in areas he controls. 
	 Netanyahu, hanging on to power with a 61-59 majority in  
parliament, faces strong opposition to further pullbacks from 
far-right members of his coalition and ultra-nationalists who 
usually vote with the government. 
	 Ten legislators published an open letter to Netanyahu in the  
Jerusalem Post newspaper Friday threatening to ``act to bring 
down the government'' if it hands over more of the biblical Land 
of Israel, which includes the West Bank.
