rejected political reform for Indonesia for the next five years 
despite mounting student demonstrations demanding change and an 
end to his 32-year rule. 
	 Interior Minister Radan Hartono quoted Suharto as telling a  
meeting of government, military and political leaders that 
constitutionally, political reform could not come before the 
year 2003. 
	 Hartono, who retired as army chief of staff last year, also  
issued an unspecified warning to activists who threatened 
national stability. 
	 The way to reform was open, but in a constitutional manner,  
he said. 
	 ``If stability is disturbed, whether from a political,  
economic or security point of view, and if they (activists) 
don't understand the effects of their actions, we will face 
them,'' he added. 
	 Violent anti-government student protests continued in the  
North Sumatran city of Medan with some of 500 demonstrators 
throwing gasoline bombs at security forces. Riot police used 
tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon to drive them back to 
their campus at the Islamic University of North Sumatra. 
	 Witnesses said schoolboys joined the protests for the first  
time as the demonstrators called on Suharto to quit to take 
responsibility for the worst economic crisis in decades. 
	 The collapse of the rupiah currency since July last year  
plunged the nation of 200 million people into crisis, causing 
prices and unemployment to soar, throwing most companies into 
technical bankruptcy and virtually halting trade. 
	 The executive board of the International Monetary Fund is  
due to meet in Washington on Monday to review progress in 
reforms Indonesia has undertaken in return for a bail-out of 
more than $40 billion. 
	 Other protests against the 76-year-old president were  
reported on Friday on the most-populous Java island, including 
the main cities of Jakarta, Yogyakarta, Surabaya and Bandung. 
There were no immediate reports of serious trouble. 
	 Student activists said further demonstrations were planned  
for Saturday, Education Day. 
	 Hartono quoted Suharto as telling the government meeting in  
his presidential office that ``state guidelines had been set 
until 2003, so if there is to be political reform, let us 
prepare for it after 2003.'' 
	 Indonesia's top constitutional body, the People's  
Consultative Assembly (MPR), met for its five-yearly session in 
early March. It re-elected Suharto for a seventh term in office 
and approved broad government policy outlines for the next five 
years. 
	 Students started anti-government protests in mid-February,  
and the government has generally tolerated them so long as the 
demonstrators remained on campus. 
	 The most violent protests so far have come in recent days in  
Medan, the commodities capital of Sumatra where students from 
several institutions have joined the demonstrations. 
	 Diplomatic analysts said there was no sign of a let-up in  
the demonstrations, which were being fuelled by economic 
hardships the students were suffering. They were getting support 
from academics, intellectuals and members of the public, with 
reported sympathisers even among the military. 
	 There appeared to be no national organization or leader  
guiding the protests, however. 
	 ``They are in a sort of loose coalition. It's not a formal  
coalition, but they want the same ends; political and economic 
reforms,'' one diplomatic analyst said. 
	 Indonesia has also come under pressure from the United  
States and human rights groups over the abduction of some 15 
political activists, some of whom were later released. 
	 Defense Minister and armed forces chief General Wiranto and  
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas told reporters separately after the 
meeting with Suharto that police would investigate the 
disappearances. 
	 Both denied it was government policy to intimidate  
activists, while the army has said it would sue Indonesian media 
which suggested the military was responsible. 
	 Wiranto, a former close aide to Suharto, said he had also  
set up a team to investigate whether there was any military 
involvement in the disappearances. 
	 On Monday, student activist Pius Lustrilanang fled to the  
Netherlands after a news conference at which he alleged he was 
abducted, tortured and told he faced death if he spoke out. 
	 Lustrilanang said the armed forces, known in Indonesia by  
the acronym ABRI, should take responsibility for his ordeal. 
	 The U.S. State Department called his story ``disturbing''  
and called on the Indonesian government to investigate it. 
	 ``We must find out who is doing this and we will take action  
according to the law,'' Alatas said. 
	 Indonesia's top human rights body said it was clear the  
abductions were carried out by a well-organised group. 
	 ``The people who were reported missing, from what we  
observed and monitored, did not disappear voluntarily, but were 
kidnapped,'' the National Human Rights Commission, which the 
government set up, said in a statement late on Thursday. 
	 ``Based on the accounts of those who have returned, we can  
conclude that the abductions were carried out by a 
well-organized group,'' it said.
