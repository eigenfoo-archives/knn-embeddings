northeastern Indonesia today, more of the near-daily civil unrest 
stemming from residents' political and economic frustration. 
	In the capital, troops blocked more than 1,000 students from  
marching on the home of former President Suharto, and about 200 
protesters were stopped from staging a sit-in at the attorney 
general's office. Dozens more students protested outside the 
studios of Television Republik Indonesia, complaining about that 
network's coverage of political events. 
	Meanwhile, angry residents of Pinrang, on Sulawesi Island 850  
miles northeast of Jakarta, also were out en masse today, a day 
after police and witnesses said mobs there burned local government 
buildings. 
	While students have been demanding Suharto be put on trial for  
corruption, Pinrang demonstrators are furious about other matters: 
Thousands of depositors of a troubled finance cooperative have been 
unable to get their money refunded. 
	The official Antara news agency also reported today on a protest  
Wednesday in the provincial city of Semarang, saying police beat 
students who were calling for Suharto to be put on trial. At least 
54 demonstrators were injured, it said. 
	No arrests or injuries were reported in today's demonstrations.  
	The surge in student protests comes as Indonesia grapples with  
its worst economic crisis in 30 years. 
	Student activists who helped oust Suharto in May have stepped up  
their demands that the former army general be held accountable for 
official wrongdoing during his 32 years of authoritarian rule. 
	Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, announced last week  
that he would set up a new inquiry into his former mentor's wealth. 
A previous investigation by Attorney General Andi Muhammad Ghalib 
turned up no evidence of wrongdoing -- a report critics labeled a 
whitewash. 
	Students repeatedly have tried to march to Suharto's heavily  
guarded home. Today, they taunted security personnel who were armed 
with bamboo shields and sticks and held up pictures of Suharto 
dressed as a bandit. 
	The standoff was in a park adjacent to the U.S. ambassador's  
house and about a half-mile from Suharto's home. 
	As many as 31 people have been killed in demonstrations and  
riots in Jakarta in the past two weeks. The total includes at least 
nine students killed when security forces opened fire Nov. 13 as 
protesters, demanding democratic reforms, tried to march on the 
Parliament. 
	In Washington, the State Department urged Indonesia to carry out  
its pledge to fully investigate the shootings.
