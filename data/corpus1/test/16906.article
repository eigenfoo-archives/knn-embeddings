wall of economic and political selfishness as divisive as the 
communist Berlin Wall was threatening European unity. 
	 ``Since the collapse of the visible wall, another invisible  
one has been discovered, one that continues to divide our 
continent -- the wall that exists in people's hearts,'' he said 
in a sermon at an open air mass. 
	 The Pope chose Gniezno, Poland's first capital, to deliver  
his forceful message on European unity at a ceremony marking the 
1,000th anniversary of the martyrdom of St Adalbert, a 
missionary from Bohemia who helped bring Christianity to Poland 
and other countries. 
	 A rapturous crowd of some 250,000 people on a rolling  
hillside below the 14th century Gniezno cathedral, traditional 
seat of Polish Catholicism, turned out to see the 77-year-old 
Pontiff, who is on the fourth day of an 11-day pilgrimage to his 
homeland. 
	 He spoke in a strong clear voice and one pilgrim in the  
crowd said: ``This is like the Pope of old, the Pope of 10 years 
ago.'' 
	 Since the emotional trip began on Saturday, the Pope has  
attracted almost a million people who have flocked to his masses 
to hear his calls for a spiritual renewal in post-communist 
Poland as it embraces economic and political freedom. 
	 The presidents of countries whose Christian roots were  
affected by St Adalbert's mission -- Poland, Germany, Hungary, 
the Czech and Slovak Republics, Lithuania and Ukraine -- 
attended the service and later had a private meeting with the 
Pope. 
	 He urged continued commitment towards cooperation between  
European countries and added: ``No country, even a weak one, can 
be left outside the sphere of the communities which are now 
arising.'' 
	 While thanking God for the ``great gift of freedom'' granted  
to the nations of Europe with the fall of communism after 
decades of repression, the Pope declared: ``The recovery of the 
right to self-determination and growth of political and economic 
freedom are not sufficient to rebuild European unity.'' 
	 He suggested in his sermon that the new invisible wall was  
no less insidious than the old one which physically divided the 
continent. 
	 ``It is a wall made out of fear and aggressiveness, of a  
lack of understanding for people of different origins, different 
colour, different religious convictions,'' he said. 
	 ``It is the wall of political and economic selfishness, of  
the weakening of sensitivity for the value of human life and the 
dignity of every human being. 
	 ``Even the undeniable achievements of recent years in the  
economic, political and social fields do not hide the fact that 
this wall exists,'' he said. 
	 This invisible wall, the Pope said, was casting a shadow  
over all of Europe. 
	 ``The goal of the authentic unity of the European continent  
is still distant. There will be no European unity until it is 
based on unity of the spirit,'' the Pontiff said. 
	 Before the mass, the Pope prayed before the relics of St  
Adalbert in a tomb in the cathedral. 
	 John Paul, who has suffered a series of health problems in  
recent years, has been holding up relatively well since he 
started the gruelling trip which will take him to 12 cities and 
towns before he returns to Rome on June 10.
