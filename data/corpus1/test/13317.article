were killed in a mid-air crash of two army helicopters Tuesday 
night in the worst military air disaster in the Jewish state's 
history. 
	 The collision in northern Israel took place in stormy  
weather but army spokesman Oded Ben-Ami said: ``As far as we 
know right now the weather was not a problem.'' He said the 
cause was under investigation but ruled out a guerrilla attack. 
	 Northern army commander Major-General Amiram Levine said the  
two helicopters collided while taking fighters and commanders 
into Lebanon, adding: ``There are about 70 dead.'' 
	 Army radio said the soldiers belonged to elite units.  
	 ``It's a terrible tragedy. It's the worst tragedy the air  
force has known in its 50-year history,'' said Israel's 
President Ezer Weizman, a pilot himself since before the Jewish 
state's creation in 1948 and Israel's former deputy army chief. 
	 Security sources described the two helicopters as  
American-made Sikorsky CH-53 transporters, each taking 37 people 
to Israel's self-declared south Lebanon occupation zone. 
	 They crashed in northern Israel near Shaar Yishuv settlement  
in the Galilee Panhandle around 7 p.m. (1700 GMT). 
	 Witnesses said there were explosions after the crash,  
apparently caused by ammunition in the cargo. Rescue workers 
evacuated dozens of bodies on stretchers. 
	 David Bar-Illan, a spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin  
Netanyahu, said it was doubtful any passengers survived. 
Witnesses said hospitals received no wounded. 
	 Bar-Illan told BBC World Service Television it was ``as  
great a disaster as anything in recent years.'' In May 1977, a 
Sikorsky crashed, killing 54 Israeli paratroopers, the army 
said. 
	 Netanyahu cancelled a trip to Jordan planned for Wednesday  
and put off a meeting planned for Thursday with Palestinian 
President Yasser Arafat. Both Jordan's King Hussein and Arafat 
conveyed condolences. 
	 ``We went outside and we saw a helicopter hang in the air  
and then fall on the bungalows near our house,'' resident Sylvia 
Cohen said. ``I went outside and saw soldiers on the ground. I 
tried to resuscitate one of them. It was a terrible sight.'' 
	 Another witness told reporters: ``There was clearly some  
problem that it simply sounded as if something was about to 
happen.'' 
	 ``I saw about 30 bodies on the ground. Some had their legs  
cut off. There were some in civilian clothes. They were all 
lined up by the side of the road,'' said another witness. 
	 The Galilee Panhandle is best known to the world as the  
target of Katyusha rockets fired by Arab guerrillas from 
Lebanon. Shaar Yishuv is situated a few kilometres (miles) 
northeast of the northern Israeli settlement of Kiryat Shmona. 
	 Military censors held up publication of the report for two  
hours in an effort first to notify families. But the sheer size 
of the disaster made keeping it secret impossible in a country 
where news travels fast. 
	 Army radio said parents of soldiers serving in the north  
were being asked to keep their phone lines open to speed 
notification. 
	 Military helicopters circled overhead immediately after the  
crash, witnesses said. They said wreckage fell on bungalows in 
the farming community and at least one caught fire but police 
said no residents were killed. 
	 About 1,000 Israeli soldiers patrol a 15 km (nine mile)-wide  
occupation zone in south Lebanon carved out in 1985 to prevent 
guerrilla attacks on the Jewish state's northern border. 
	 ``This is an unimaginably heavy tragedy. The hearts of the  
nation are with the victims. The whole country weeps today over 
the loss of these young fighters,'' Netanyahu said in a 
statement issued by his office. 
	 Last March a Sikorsky helicopter crashed in southern Israel  
minutes after takeoff, killing seven soldiers.
