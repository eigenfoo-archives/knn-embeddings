might try to pull a sunken Haitian ferry into shallow water 
Wednesday, using a Bahamian salvage vessel and a wrecker on 
shore. 
	 Divers Tuesday entered a watery tomb to pull bodies from the  
ferry, which sank a few yards from shore, trapping passengers 
below deck and possibly killing more than 200 people. 
	 Haitian President Rene Preval and government ministers  
traveled to the disaster scene where angry villagers demanded to 
know why the government had not done more to prevent the 
accident or rescue those trapped. 
	 And while there was no clear answer to the question of how  
many people were aboard the ferry, a government official said it 
may have been overloaded. 
	 The ferry La Fierte Gonavienne (Pride of Gonave) sank in 120  
feetof water Monday just 50 yardsfrom shore at Montrouis. It was 
Haiti's worst maritime tragedy since the 1993 capsize of the 
ferry Neptune that may have killed more than 1,000 people. 
	 Divers pulled 28 bodies from the shipwreckTuesday, bringing  
to nearly 80 the number of victims recovered, authorities said. 
The number included 26 bodies recovered by U.N. troopsMonday and 
about two dozen that washed or were dragged ashore in the hours 
after the boat went down. 
	 Col. Gaston Cote, commander of the Canadian contingent in  
the U.N. peacekeeping force, said divers had not yet been able 
to get into the lowest deck level within the hull and did not 
know how many victims might be there. 
	 ``The majority of bodies we've been recovering are in the  
second level,'' he said. ``To get into that (bottom) level we 
would need steel cutting equipment which we don't have.'' 
	 As the bodies were placed on the stony beach, searched and  
tucked into clear plastic bags, anguished wails went up from a 
crowd of hundreds of victims' relatives and villagers. 
	 ``I didn't know he was on the boat,'' screamed Milad  
Medilien as she caught sight of the body of her son, Wilber 
Vilene, 26. Another woman whose brother was on the boat 
collapsed on the ground, sobbing. 
	 Robert Manuel, Haiti's secretary of state for security, said  
the vessel was permitted to carry 200 passengers. ``There very 
well may have been too many people on the boat,'' he said. 
	 Haitian National Police Chief Pierre Denize said an  
investigation had been launched. Asked about the possibility of 
criminal charges, he said: ``There is reason enough to warrant 
the owner and the captain to be questioned.'' 
	 Witnesses said the vessel rolled when passengers eager to  
get off went to one side. In an area with no dock, people 
routinely disembark ferries by wading, swimming or being carried 
to shore. 
	 Capt. Andre Mathieu, a Canadian diver, said the area below  
deck was choked with bodies. ``We are estimating between 120-200 
bodies in the boat,'' he told Reuters. 
	 The recovery was complicated by the depth. Divers can only  
work for 15 minutes at 120 feetbefore surfacing. Some bodies 
were difficult to remove because the victims had grabbed 
projections or been entangled in railings and were immobilized 
in place, the divers said. 
	 Preval, his wife Guerda, and his cabinet ministers left the  
capital early Tuesday on the 40-milejourney north to Montrouis, 
on the west coast. 
	 ``It's a catastrophe,'' Preval said. ``We are here to see  
what we can do. We are here to see what happened.'' 
	 They were surrounded by a crowd of villagers, some of them  
visibly angry. 
	 ``Why are you coming here now?'' screamed a woman who lost  
five children in the accident. ``There was no one here yesterday 
to pull the boat up out of the water. Now everyone's dead.'' 
	 The number of passengers aboard the vessel and the number  
who perished were uncertain. The ferry's manager said the vessel 
had 260 on board. A local government official said 276 tickets 
were sold but that figure did not include children.
