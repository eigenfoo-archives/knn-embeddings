United States traded barbs about how to cope with global warming 
on Monday, the first day of a United Nations conference 
negotiating how to reduce greenhouse gases. 
	 The U.S., the world's biggest polluter, made the most  
significant change to its position for months, but still ran 
into a row with the Europeans on the fairest way to proceed. 
	 EU officials said the row was a bad omen for the success of  
the meeting involving more than 150 nations. 
	 In a policy shift, Assistant Secretary of State Melinda  
Kimble for the first time said the U.S. would consider 
``differentiation,'' instead of a common cut for all developed 
nations. 
	 Under ``differentiation,'' there could be varying percentage  
reductions by nations. 
	 ``In the interest of moving our negotiations forward, and  
seeking to be as flexible as possible.... we are prepared to 
consider the possibility of limited, carefully bounded 
differentiation,'' Kimble said in a speech to delegates. 
	 Conference president Hiroshi Oki, Japan's environment  
minister, said climate change was one of the most serious 
environmental issues the world had encountered. 
	 ``Only a fully worldwide strategy can effectively address  
the problem of climate change,'' Oki said in an opening speech. 
	 ``Projected changes in climate will result in significant,  
often adverse, impacts on many ecological systems and 
socio-economic sectors. Developing countries and small island 
countries are especially vulnerable to climate change.'' 
	 Forecasts of effects include low-lying island states  
disappearing under the ocean as water levels rise from the 
heating up of polar ice caps, the spread of deserts, and a rise 
in tropical diseases such as malaria. 
	 But business leaders fear the costs could have equally  
damaging effects on economic growth and jobs. 
	 At talks over the next 10 days, delegates will try to settle  
on a plan to cut gases such as carbon dioxide, produced from 
burning oil, coal and other fossil fuels. 
	 Under fire for not doing enough as the world's biggest  
producer of gases, Washington's Kimble went on the attack 
against the EU which has scored points over the U.S. for 
offering greater cuts. 
	 In what shaped up as a new trans-Atlantic row, she said the  
U.S. had ``strong concerns about the proposed EU 'bubble'.'' 
	 Under the EU ``bubble'' plan, the bloc as a whole, rather  
than individual countries, would cut emissions by 15 percent 
from 1990 levels by 2010, compared with a U.S. offer to just 
stabilise emissions at 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. 
	 Kimble said the EU plan needed further explanation in five  
areas including what happens if more nations join the bloc. 
	 She later told reporters by allowing some EU members to even  
increase their emissions, balancing them with cuts by others, 
there was not a ``level playing field.'' 
	 She said as there was an economic cost to nations in cutting  
emissions, the U.S. could be at a trading disadvantage. 
	 EU spokesman Jorgen Henningsen, director for the environment  
and natural resources, shot back that Washington seemed 
perturbed by the EU's ambitions for the environment. 
	 ``If the strong concerns....are the fact that the EU  
position is uncomfortably ambitious for the U.S. then I would 
say we have a comparable concern that the U.S. position is 
uncomfortably unambitious from our point of view,'' Henningsen 
told Reuters Television. 
	 Luxemburg ambassador Pierre Gramegna, EU delegation head  
because his country holds the EU presidency at the moment, said 
Europe could not understand the U.S. ``attack.'' 
	 He described it as a ``bad omen'' for reaching an agreement.  
	 ``We have detected (U.S.) flexibility, but it is in the  
wrong direction,'' Gramegna said. 
	 The Third Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework  
Convention on Climate Change (COP3) will hold official-level 
talks until next Monday when ministers, including possibly U.S. 
Vice President Al Gore, take over the final negotiations. 
	 In a sign of fissures, discussion has already started on how  
to word a fallback position if the meeting does not agree on a 
binding protocol by the time it ends on December 10.
