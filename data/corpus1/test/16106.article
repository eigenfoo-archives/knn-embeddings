hearing the echoes of war, Sunday honored its 18,538 soldiers 
killed in nearly half a century of independence. 
	 Air raid sirens brought the Jewish state to a standstill for  
its national memorial day amid little sign of progress in U.S. 
efforts to renew Israel-PLO talks and warnings from Israeli 
generals that a peace deadlock would bring war nearer. 
	 ``Today it is clear that despite the difficulties ahead, we  
are moving surely, step by step, toward an era of acceptance by 
our neighbors of Israel's existence,'' Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu said at a memorial ceremony. 
	 ``This acceptance stems from their understanding that they  
cannot destroy us and erase the fact of our existence,'' he 
said, calling a strong army ``the true basis for the hope of 
peace.'' 
	 U.S. envoy Dennis Ross, on his second mission in a month,  
searched for a formula to revive peace negotiations frozen since 
Netanyahu's right-wing government broke ground in March for a 
Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem. 
	 ``The general assessment by military intelligence remains  
the same: a rise in the likelihood that tensions in the area 
will slide to confrontation,'' Israeli army chief of staff Amnon 
Shahak told the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper. 
	 Tens of thousands of Israelis poured into military  
cemeteries to attend ceremonies honoring the 18,538 soldiers who 
the Defense Ministry said had been killed since independence in 
May 1948. 
	 Israeli radio stations played somber music during  
Remembrance Day Sunday until sunset when the mood would turn 
festive for Independence Day celebrations. 
	 Netanyahu went to the Jerusalem grave of his brother  
Jonathan who was killed in Israel's 1976 commando rescue of 
hostages held by the Palestinian and German hijackers of an Air 
France plane in Entebbe, Uganda. 
	 Some Israelis marked the occasion differently. Anti-Zionist  
ultra-Orthodox Jews ignored a memorial siren Saturday night and 
hurled rocks and garbage at cars along a Jerusalem road they 
have demanded be closed on the Jewish Sabbath.
