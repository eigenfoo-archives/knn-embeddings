Israel's hardline government on Tuesday at the opening of the Tehran 
summit, branding the Jewish state an enemy of Islam and a threat to 
Middle East peace. 
   "Zionist aggression against Arab land is the most serious danger  
facing the entire Moslem community," Syrian President Hafez al-Assad 
told leaders from the 55 members of the Organisation of the Islamic 
Conference. 
   "The Zionist state has worked along with others to sow seeds of  
dissension in Arab and Moslem lands," said Assad, chosen by fellow 
Arab states to address the summit opening on their behalf. 
   The collapse of the Middle East peace process under Israel's  
nationalist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the past 18 months 
has bolstered the standing of regional hawks such as Syria and 
Iran. 
   By pushing ahead with the expansion of Jewish settlements and  
repeatedly pledging never to give up east Jerusalem, Netanyahu paved 
the way for his country's peace partners to come to Tehran. 
   Senior Iranian officials buzzed around Assad as speaker after  
speaker attacked Israel, leaving Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat 
playing second fiddle. 
   The three-day summit opened with a recital of verses from  
Islam's holy book, the Koran, before Iran's spiritual leader 
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei set the tone with a thundering diatribe 
against Israel and the West. 
   "The enemy has set itself up on the land of Palestine, armed  
settlers, divided Arab land and annexed territory from Jordan, Egypt 
and Syria," he said, calling the peace process "unjust, humiliating 
and illogical." 
   "Is there anything more unjust than this? It is a joke,"  
Khamenei said, referring to the principle of land for peace which 
underpins the US-backed  process. 
   Khamenei, appointed leader in 1989 after the death Ayatollah  
Ruhollah Khomeini, wore the black turban of a descendant of the 
Prophet Mohammed and delivered his speech sitting in a leather-bound 
chair -- pausing from time to time to sip from a glass of water. 
   Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate cleric who won a  
surprise victory in May elections, took a more conciliatory tone 
towards the West but followed the anti-Israeli trend of the day. 
   "Israel has a bellicose, racist and terrorist nature, and its  
search for weapons of mass destruction is a threat to regional 
stability," he said. 
   Khatami, like Assad and Khamenei, called for the Moslem world to  
unite and stand together to defy Israel. 
   OIC Secretary General Ezzedin Laraki carried on the theme in his  
speech to the delegates, the largest international gathering in Iran 
in the turbulent 18-year history of the Islamic repubic. 
   "Israel is destroying peace by building Jewish settlements,  
violating human rights, killing people and demolishing houses," 
Laraki told the packed conference hall in northern Tehran. 
   Even UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, while staying a model of  
even-handedness, expressed "deep dismay" at the collapse of 
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and called on both sides to respect 
the interim peace accords. 
   Six resolutions out of 142 texts hammered out by OIC foreign  
ministers last week refer to the Arab-Israeli peace process. 
   The texts condemn the "Israel's terrorist and repressisve  
actions" and "current Israeli policy which is hostile to peace," and 
supports Palestinian demands for an independent state with east 
Jerusalem as its capital. 
   The summit of the OIC, representing 1.2 billion Moslems around  
the world, has brought more than 30 heads of state, prime ministers 
and crown princes to Iran. 
   Among the states represented at senior level are many which have  
been at daggers drawn with Iran since its 1979 revolution, including 
Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Jordan, Egypt and Kuwait. 
   Khamenei reached out to Iran's former foes, saying: "I declare  
here that no threat will ever come from Iran to any Moslem 
country." 
   Iran launched a year-long diplomatic drive to patch up  
differences with old enemies for the summit, and has hailed the 
turn-out as a victory over US attempts to isolate the country on 
terrorism charges. 
   "The massive presence of heads of states in Tehran despite  
blatant and secret US attempts at sabotage is a shining victory," 
said the moderate Hamshahri newspaper, echoing the general view of 
the press Tuesday. 
   The authorities have clamped unprecedented security measures on  
Tehran, deploying thousands of police and Revolutionary Guards. 
   The Jeddah-based OIC was set up in 1971 to foster Islamic unity  
in response to a fire two years earlier in the Al-Aqsa Mosque, one 
of Islam's holiest shrines, in Israeli-occupied east Jerusalem.
