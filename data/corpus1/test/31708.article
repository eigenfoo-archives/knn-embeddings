talks with Kosovo Albanian leaders until they gave up their 
demands for independence for the troubled province. 
	 The government reacted immediately after the main Kosovo  
Albanian leader said he was prepared to talk but not to consider 
any solution that did not grant Kosovo total independence. 
	 The international community, concerned that violence in  
Kosovo could reignite ethnic tensions in the Balkans, urged the 
two sides to open a dialogue on its future after a police 
crackdown last week in which some 80 people died. 
	 Though the fighting was reported to have ended, the  
bitterness remained as over 50 of the bodies were exhumed by 
relatives Wednesday for reburial with Muslim rites. 
	 Police and firemen had buried the bodies Tuesday after the  
families refused to inter them before independent autopsies were 
carried out by foreign pathologists. 
	 In the Kosovo capital Pristina, Ibrahim Rugova, leader of  
the main Albanian party, the LDK, said he was ready to enter a 
dialogue with Belgrade but ruled out any solution that did not 
include independence for the province. 
	  ``Former Yugoslavia has ceased to exist,'' he told  
reporters. ``Kosovo has its own borders and we have not asked 
for a change of borders. Perhaps Serbia does not think that way 
now but an independent Kosovo is a good thing for Serbia.'' 
	 He said a return to the autonomy Kosovo enjoyed before it  
was suspended by Belgrade in 1989 ``would only be a source of 
new conflicts here.'' 
	 But the government of Serbia, one of Yugoslavia's two  
constituent republics, immediately rejected the demand, 
insisting that any talks must be in accordance with Serbia's 
constitution. 
	 Asked whether Albanians would have to renounce any idea of  
secession before talks could start, Serbian Information Minister 
Radmila Milentijevic replied: 
	 ``Absolutely, because the position of the government here is  
that these talks will have to take place within Serbia and in 
accordance with the constitution of Serbia.'' 
	 Responding to Rugova's demand, she told Reuters: ``This is  
completely against our constitution, this is unacceptable for 
us, and I think this position is unfortunate because it does not 
offer the possibility of negotiations.'' 
	 The minister said it was now up to the international  
community to deal with Rugova and others sharing his views 
``because the world community has taken a very firm position in 
support of the integrity of the borders of Serbia and 
Yugoslavia.'' 
	 Western governments support a return to autonomy for Kosovo,  
where 90 percent of the 1.8 million population are ethnic 
Albanians. But they have told Rugova they will not back 
independence demands. 
	 The West is reluctant openly to put heavy pressure on the  
Kosovo Albanians in the run-up to an election in Kosovo this 
month while tempers are high over the latest deaths. 
	 But Western sources said U.S. Balkan envoy Robert Gelbard  
had warned Albanian politicians Tuesday that there was no 
alternative to compromise with Yugoslav leader Slobodan 
Milosevic. 
	 Gelbard urged Rugova to open private lines to Milosevic once  
nationalist fury had cooled. 
	 ``Rugova should know by now that independence is not an  
option and that continued violence will lessen Western 
support,'' a diplomatic source said. 
	 Gelbard said the Albanians should be given ``advanced  
status,'' which diplomats said meant greater control over their 
own affairs in Kosovo but not outright independence. 
	  Western powers led by the United States have threatened  
Milosevic with a potentially crippling tightening of economic 
sanctions if he has not made progress toward a compromise with 
Rugova within 10 days. 
	 Washington has condemned alleged terrorism by the separatist  
Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), but judged that Milosevic had 
over-reacted in his attack on the guerrillas in central Kosovo 
last week. 
	 Gelbard said Tuesday that Serb anti-terrorist units had used  
``brutal, disproportionate and overwhelming'' force against 
villages said to harbor the KLA. 
	 The U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague said it had the  
right to prosecute possible suspects in the Kosovo violence and 
was gathering evidence. 
	 In the village of Prekaz, meanwhile, Western reporters  
watched as 53 coffins were exhumed by local Albanians from a 
muddy field. Many of the bullet-riddled bodies were so badly 
charred they were beyond identification. 
	 The LDK said the dead included 12 children and 14 women. The  
victims included several men of the Jasari family, alleged by 
police to be KLA leaders. 
	 The bodies were being reburied in the same field but  
pointing toward Mecca according to Muslim custom.
