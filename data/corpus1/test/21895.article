in northern Sumatra, an area hit by smog from bush fires, and 
all 234 passengers and crew were killed, officials said. 
	 It was not immediately known whether the haze from the  
Indonesian bush fires that has sent a choking blanket of smog 
over large areas of Southeast Asia was a factor in the disaster. 
	 A local journalist who went to the crash site told Reuters  
by telephone from Medan that the plane had broken in two when it 
smashed into a deep ravine and caught fire. 
	 ``The location is very difficult. The plane was totally  
destroyed and burned out in two pieces,'' he said. ``There were 
no survivors.'' 
	 Rescue workers stumbled through mud and water carrying  
begrimed bodies on stretchers from the crash area strewn with 
debris. 
	 Rescuers said about 60 bodies had been taken from the  
wreckage. The grim task of recovering the other victims would 
resume on Saturday. 
	The Airbus A-300 B-4 jet crashed into a hill plantation of  
banana bushes and coconut palms in Indonesia's worst air 
disaster. 
	 Garuda's president-director Supandi said the airline would  
investigate the cause of the crash. The plane's makers, the 
European Airbus Industrie said it was sending a team to help in 
the probe. 
	 Supandi said the plane was approaching Medan's Polonia  
international airport on flight GA-152 from Jakarta when it went 
down at 1:55 p.m. (0555 GMT). 
	 He said visibility at the time was between 500 and 600 yards  
through the smoke haze and the airport was open for operations. 
	 State Secretary Murdiono said President Suharto had ordered  
Transport Minister Haryanto Danutirto to carry out a full 
investigation. 
	 ``We regret (the crash) and are full of sorrow,'' Supandi  
told a news conference at Jakarta's main airport in a slow and 
emotion-filled voice. 
	 He said Garuda would fly relatives of the victims to Medan  
on Saturday aboard a Boeing 747-200 jumbo jet with a 413-seat 
capacity. 
	 ``Garuda is fully responsible. We are very sad about what  
has happened today,'' Supandi said. 
	 The official Antara news agency said there were six Japanese  
and two Americans aboard. The passenger list indicated there 
were other foreigners but nationalities were not immediately 
clear. The Malaysian news agency Bernama said there were several 
Malaysians on board. 
	 One of Indonesia's leading businessmen, Polar Yanto Tanoto,  
was also among the passengers. 
	 Tanoto, the president director of pulp and rayon company PT  
Inti Indorayon Utama, was flying back to his head office in 
Medan, a company spokesman said. 
	 Other passengers included a two-member camera crew for the  
local SCTV television station flying to Medan to report on the 
smog, Garuda officials said. 
	 Indonesia, spread along the equator and comprising about  
17,500 islands, relies heavily on air transport although 
international experts are often critical of the standard of 
training and maintenance practices in its aviation sector. 
	 In July, a Fokker F-27 operated by Sempati Air crashed soon  
after take-off from the West Java city of Bandung, killing 30 
people. 
	 A Garuda McDonnell Douglas DC-10 caught fire after an  
aborted take-off at Japan's Fukuoka airport in June 1996, 
killing at least three people and injuring 99. 
	 Indonesia's previous worst air disaster was in 1992, when an  
air force Hercules C-130 crashed into a Jakarta suburb, killing 
136 people. 
	 Airbus Industrie said in a statement that the plane that  
crashed on Friday had logged over 26,950 flight hours in some 
16,500 flights. 
	 The aircraft was powered by Pratt & Whitney JTD9D-59A  
engines. Pratt & Whitney is a subsidiary of United Technologies 
Corp.
