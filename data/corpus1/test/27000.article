Netanyahu took his cabinet on a helicopter tour of the West Bank 
Tuesday to assess which areas of the territory Israel should refuse 
to turn over to Palestinian rule. 
   But the right-wing Israeli leader cautioned that the visit did  
not mean his cabinet was near deciding on a promised new troop 
pullback from the West Bank. 
   "We are looking at what is vital and important to Israel and  
what we must keep," Netanyahu told reporters as he and 13 of his 
ministers visited this hilltop Jewish settlement overlooking 
Israel's coastal plain. 
   Army officers pointed out the close proximity to the densely  
populated Tel Aviv region and the importance of the local Jewish 
settlements to prevent contiguous Palestinian control so close to 
Israel's slim center. 
   "We can see how narrow Israel used to be and how vulnerable it  
would be if we return to (the 1967 borders)," Netanyahu said, 
adding, "We of course don't intend to do that." 
   The officers noted that Alfei Menashe sat only 16 kilometers (10  
miles) from the Mediterranean Sea and four kilometers (two miles) 
from the Palestinian-run West Bank town of Qalqilya, hence its 
importance to block the "spread" of Arab communities near Israel's 
main city. 
   Hardline National Infrastructures Minister Ariel Sharon made  
clear the government would not give in to US or other pressure to 
quickly carry out the new troop pullout required under signed peace 
accords. 
   "No one should wait with a stopwatch," Sharon said. "Every  
additional day we have to consider the problem will only contribute 
to peace because peace should provide security." 
   The Israeli cabinet agreed in principle to a withdrawal from the  
West Bank earlier this month but had yet to decide the scope and 
timing. They say they must first decide the areas to be kept in a 
final peace deal before deciding on the next pullout. 
   The United States has demanded a "significant" withdrawal by  
mid-January to invigorate the peace process stalled for nine 
months. 
   Foreign Minister David Levy, the cabinet's most outspoken  
moderate on the peace process, boycotted the tour to protest the 
slow decision process. 
   The tour in three army helicopters was organized at Sharon's  
demand as part of cabinet deliberations on a final peace settlement 
with the Palestinians and the interim withdrawal. 
   Sharon favors keeping 60 percent of the West Bank in a final  
deal with the Palestinians, including wide strips along the eastern 
and western sides of the territory, roads criss-crossing the area 
and all 144 Jewish settlements. 
   Defense Minister Yizhak Mordechai has a rival proposal drawn up  
in conjuction with army planners which would keep 50 percent of the 
West Bank under Israeli control. 
   Mordechai however denied press reports that his plan would leave  
some Jewish settlements isolated in Palestinian-ruled areas. 
   The Palestinians have warned they would not accept any proposal  
for a final deal that does not give them most of the West Bank, 
including east Jerusalem, where they hope, together with the Gaza 
Strip, to create a state. 
   The ministers' tour came as Palestinian, Israeli and US  
officials tried to complete a security agreement that Netanyahu has 
made a precondition to any further withdrawal. 
   Palestinian officials said Netanyahu had stalled the  
finalization of the deal on Monday because it left out a requirement 
the Palestinians turn over to Israel suspects in terror attacks. 
   Netanyahu also did not approve that the draft of the pact  
calling for a crackdown on radicals equated Jewish extremists with 
Islamic HAMAS militants, the Palestinians said. 
   The delays in a decision on the withdrawal and the security pact  
bogged down efforts to work out a Washington summit slated for 
January between Netanyahu, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and US 
President Bill Clinton, Palestinian officials said.
