North Korea that ``the world will find a way'' to feed its 
people and urged Pyongyang to join peace talks that have failed 
to start due to North Korea's demand for food. 
	 ``I would urge the North Koreans to reconsider and to enter  
the talks as soon as possible,'' Clinton told a news conference 
concluding his talks with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro 
Hashimoto. 
	 North Korea wants more food aid to help its malnourished  
people before agreeing to four-nation talks with South Korea, 
the United States and China on achieving peace with South Korea. 
	 Meetings in New York broke up last week without securing  
Pyongyang's participation. The North Korean delegation told the 
United States it planned to return home Friday. 
	 Urging Pyongyang to return to the New York negotiations,  
Clinton said: ``We have given them every opportunity to come 
with honor and be treated with fairness and it is time to bring 
this long divide to an end as well as to alleviate the misery of 
so many of their people.'' 
	 The United States has already pledged food aid and has urged  
Japan to do so as well, but Tokyo has been reluctant, pointing 
to humanitarian disputes with the Stalinist state, including 
reported abductions of Japanese by North Koreans. 
	 ``The real answer here is that the world will find a way to  
keep the people of North Korea from starving and from dealing 
with malnutrition. But they (the North Koreans) need to lift the 
burden of a system that is failing them in food and other ways, 
off their back (and) resolve their differences with the South,'' 
Clinton said. 
	 But there was no sign of a change in Japan's position on  
North Korean food aid during Hashimoto's visit, which included a 
sumptuous lunch of sea scallops and Oregon Kobe beef. 
	 Hashimoto told the news conference that ``we certainly are  
aware of the situation in North Korea that requires humanitarian 
food aid.'' 
	 ``At the same time, if we speak of humanitarian  
circumstances, there are certain things we would like the North 
Koreans to do for us,'' he said. 
	 He cited as an example Japanese women married to North  
Korean husbands who are not allowed to visit their relatives in 
Japan or write letters home. 
	 During five hours of talks -- including two hours informally  
late Thursday -- Clinton delivered the fairly blunt message that 
the United States would not like to see Japan's trade surplus 
with America go up for a prolonged period like it has in the 
past. 
	 ``Obviously, we don't want it to go back up,'' he said.  
	 Japan's trade surplus with the United States rose 11.2  
percent to $3.04 billion in March, the sixth straight month it 
has gone up. A weak yen against the dollar has helped make 
Japanese exports more competitive. 
	 Hashimoto attempted to assure Clinton that Tokyo's trade  
surplus with America is likely to fall over the long term 
because it is expected that Japan's economy will grow, spurred 
by increased domestic demand. U.S. officials say they do not 
want Japan to export its way out of recession. 
	 On bilateral security issues, Hashimoto said his government  
has ``no intention'' of asking for the reduction of U.S. forces 
in Japan. The large U.S. military presence in Japan, 
particularly at Okinawa, has created tensions with local 
residents. 
	 Clinton said the United States was sensitive to the problem  
and was doing all it could to minimize the impact of the troop 
presence on the Japanese population.
