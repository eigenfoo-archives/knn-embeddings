met in northern Thailand Friday to discuss moving a Karen refugee 
camp in the wake of a deadly attack there this week, district 
officials said. 
   Thai officials, police and representatives of non-governmental  
organizations met in the northern district of Mae Sot to consider a 
proposal to move the camp attacked by Myanmar-based guerrillas. 
   "Everyone agrees that the old site of the camp is not safe, and  
should be moved," Mae Sot district chief Thawatchai Fakangkul told 
AFP. 
   "We will be just proposing ideas and talking things over today.  
There will not likely be any decision on future moves as this must 
be made at a higher provincial level," he added. 
   Not all refugees wanted to leave the camp, he said, despite the  
state of panic inside. 
   A new site will be chosen "as soon as possible" as the refugees  
are now living in makeshift tents, schools, and temples around the 
Huay Kalok camp which was raised to the ground in Wednesday's 
attack. 
   Thai Third army chief of staff Major General Chamlong Phothong  
said earlier that army and ministry of interior officials had agreed 
to move the Huay Kalok camp further inside Thai territory. 
   The camp, just four kilometers (three miles) from the border,  
was attacked by troops from the Myanmar-based pro-Yangon Democratic 
Karen Buddhist Army (DKBA). 
   Reports said some 70 to 100 DKBA troops crossed into northern  
Thailand on Wednesday and attacked the camp, killing three refugees, 
including a child, and setting fire to more than 1,000 dwellings. 
   Huay Kalok, one of three Karen refugee camps in Mae Sot district  
of Tak province, houses almost 10,000 refugees loyal to the Karen 
National Union General Bo Mya, a staunch opponent of the DKBA and 
the Myanmar government. 
   "We would like to see the camp relocated deeper inside Thailand  
for the safety of the refugees living in them," Karen National Union 
Refugee Committee spokesperson Robert Htwe said Friday. 
   "Despite wanting to see the refugees being relocated, it really  
depends on the Thai authorities as to where and even whether they 
will be moved," Htwe added. 
   The Karen Buddhist Army and the Karen National Union (KNU) split  
in 1994. Analysts say the former aligned itself with Myanmar's 
military authorities, while the KNU refused to do so. 
   On Thursday, Myanmar's military government angrily denied  
accusations that it was waging a "campaign of terror" against ethnic 
minorities in Thai refugee camps after the violent attack this 
week. 
   In a terse statement received here, a top official in Yangon's  
State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) rejected accusations from 
the US State Department that the junta was behind the attack on 
Karen refugees. 
   US State Department spokesman James Rubin on Wednesday condemned  
the attack and called on Myanmar, to halt the "campaign of terror 
and violence." 
   A United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees statement  
Thursday urged the Thai government to take measures to guarantee the 
security of refugees near the Thai-Myanmar border. 
   Controversy has reigned since the attack on whether Thai  
military forces guarding the camp did enough to protect it, with one 
NGO accusing Thai authorities of knowing about the attack in 
advance. 
   Wednesday's incident was the second time Myanmar rebel forces  
have burned down large parts of the Huay Kalok refugee camp.
