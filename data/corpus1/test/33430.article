President Boris Yeltsin's candidate for prime minister, Sergei 
Kiriyenko, but the margin of defeat for the Kremlin nominee was 
smaller than expected. 
   Deputies in the State Duma lower house voted by 186 votes  
against to 143 votes in favour, with five abstentions. 
   Kiriyenko needed to secure 226 votes in the 450-seat chamber to  
be confirmed as premier. 
   "I expected fewer votes," Kiriyenko said after the first round  
vote. "I intend to continue my work and will continue consultations 
with the Duma. 
   "I will not be conciliatory on the question of (government)  
officials," he added. "I have a position of principle, and to go 
back has no sense for me. To accept bargaining will not result in a 
good government." 
   According to the results of the vote, the liberal opposition  
Yabloko party did not take part in the ballot, while several of the 
Communist opposition bloc similarly declined to participate. 
   "It's a slap in the face for Yeltsin," said Sergei Ivanenko,  
number two with the liberal opposition bloc Yabloko. "Kiriyenko has 
nothing to do with it." 
   Parliament has three chances to approve the president's  
candidate. Three "no" votes entitle the head of state to dissolve 
the chamber and call fresh legislative elections. 
   Parliament had been widely expected to overwhelmingly reject  
Yeltsin's young lieutenant in the first ballot. 
   Deputies of all political hues argued that Kiriyenko's four  
months as energy minister were insufficient qualification for the 
second most powerful politician of a nuclear power. 
   Yeltsin has pledged to stick with his candidate, and his  
spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said the Russian president would 
propose Kiriyenko's name to parliament soon after a rejection. 
   Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov reiterated after the vote that he  
would seek talks with Yeltsin on Monday to try and persuade the 
president to put forward a different candidate in the second round, 
Interfax reported. 
   But he added that parliament was expecting notification from  
Yeltsin "any minute" of his decision to resubmit Kiriyenko's 
candidacy.
