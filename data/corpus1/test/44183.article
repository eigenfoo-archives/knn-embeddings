tear gas and water cannons today to disperse thousands of students 
during the biggest day of protest so far against a government 
assembly on political reform. 
	Students fought back, hurling bottles and chunks of concrete at  
police in helmets who chased and beat them with canes. Adding to 
the nighttime chaos in central Jakarta, military-backed civilian 
guards flailed with sharpened bamboo sticks at bystanders. 
	At least 31 injured students were taken to hospitals, more than  
half of them in critical condition with plastic bullet wounds. One 
policeman was hurt, state-run radio said. 
	The violence showed the divisions that Indonesia faces as it  
edges toward democracy after 32 years of authoritarian rule, with 
students pressing for sweeping change and the government urging a 
slower pace. 
	The demonstration turned violent after vastly outnumbered police  
and soldiers failed to block an estimated 20,000 marchers, many 
chanting ``Let us through'' and waving Indonesian flags. 
	On two main roads near Parliament, students scattered as  
officers fired shots, but later regrouped. Security forces had been 
ordered to carry blanks and plastic bullets. 
	The protesters had been trying to march to Parliament, where the  
nation's highest legislative body met to plan Indonesia's 
transition to democracy. Students, however, accuse the People's 
Consultative Assembly of trying to hinder reforms. 
	Fearing new violence, banks, shops and offices in Jakarta closed  
their doors and sent workers home early today. Streets were clear 
of vehicles in the usually traffic-clogged, tropical capital. 
	The mood recalled riots in May that left 1,200 dead and helped  
oust former President Suharto, a former army general who rose to 
power in the 1960s. 
	Those riots, fueled by discontent over Indonesia's worst  
economic crisis in decades, erupted after military personnel 
fatally shot four student protesters. 
	This week, several protests have ended in violence. Students who  
accuse the government of stalling Indonesia's transition to 
democracy have clashed with riot police and military-backed 
civilian guards. 
	In a move likely to further anger students, government leaders  
said today that 1999 parliamentary elections were likely to be 
delayed until July, two months later than President B.J. Habibie 
had promised. 
	Marzuki Darusman, a leader of the ruling Golkar party, cited  
tie-ups in drafting electoral laws. 
	Activists are skeptical that delegates to a meeting of the  
People's Consultative Assembly are willing to shake off their 
legacy as Suharto followers and implement democratic reforms. The 
1,000-member assembly is Indonesia's highest legislative body and 
includes elected lawmakers, military representatives and government 
appointees. 
	Convening in the green-domed legislative building, delegates  
debated whether to escalate an investigation of Suharto, who is 
accused of human rights abuses and enriching his family at state 
expense. 
	An investigation of Suharto's business holdings is under way,  
but government prosecutors say they have found no evidence of 
wrongdoing. Students dismiss those findings as biased. 
	Thousands of people watched today's street rally, occasionally  
clapping and cheering. 
	The students took a circuitous route toward Parliament, around  
which security forces had set up roadblocks. Some 30,000 police and 
soldiers were on duty in the capital.
