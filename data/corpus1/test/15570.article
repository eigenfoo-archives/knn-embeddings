plans to fly over the flood-ravaged Minnesota-North Dakota border to get 
a first-hand look at devastation caused by the swollen Red River. 
	Congress must approve the $788 million in federal aid President  
Clinton is seeking to provide relief for flood victims. 
	The Red River crested at Grand Forks, N.D., at more than 54 feet -- 26  
feet over flood stage. The water has receded about four feet since then, 
but is expected to remain high for several more days. 
	Gingrich is scheduled to arrive a Grand Forks Air Foce base late  
Friday afternoon to join Minnesota Gov. Arne Carlson and Rep. Collin 
Peterson, D-Minn., on an aerial tour of the flood plain. 
	Officials allowed more residents of Grand Forks, N.D. and East Grand  
Forks, Minn., to return to their homes to retrieve valuables and assess 
the damage. But it will be weeks before they are able to go home for 
good -- if they have a home left to return to. 
	Hundreds of northern Minnesota resorts have opened their doors to  
accomodate flood evacuees. Minnesota Resort Association spokesman Tom 
Day says some members are allowing flood victims to stay for free, while 
others are offering reduced rates to those who have already received 
federal disaster money. 
	Its a race against time for farmers waiting for floodwaters to recede  
so they can start spring planting. Some won't be able to harvest in the 
fall if planting isn't completed by the end of May. 
	An estimated 3 million acres of farmland in Minnesota and North  
Dakota is still under water.
