rubber bullets shot and slightly wounded 20 Palestinian 
protesters in the West Bank town of Hebron on Saturday, 
witnesses said. 
	 The Hebron clashes erupted when dozens of Palestinian youths  
began hurling stones and petrol bombs at Israeli troops guarding 
Jewish enclaves in the city of 100,000 Palestinians. Some 400 
Jewish settlers live in the heavily fortified enclaves. 
	 The Israeli army confirmed there were clashes but said so  
far it had no reports of casualties. 
	 Several Palestinian demonstrators told Reuters they had come  
to confront the Israelis to protest against a non-binding U.S. 
House of Representatives resolution on Tuesday calling on 
President Bill Clinton to affirm that Jerusalem must remain 
Israel's undivided capital. 
	 Witnesses said they saw demonstrators drag away at least 20  
Palestinians who had been hit by rubber bullets -- some to 
nearby ambulances which took them to hospital and others to 
Palestinian medical personnel who treated them on the spot. 
	 They said there were no Palestinian police at the scene.  
	 Israel handed 80 percent of Hebron to Palestinian rule in  
January under an interim peace deal but kept troops to protect 
the settler enclaves in the town. 
	 Earlier on Saturday, Palestinian gunmen shot and wounded an  
Israeli woman motorist on the outskirts of Har Adar Jewish 
settlement in the West Bank north of Jerusalem, Israeli security 
sources said. 
	 The army said that at least one gunman hit a woman driving a  
car at Har Adar near the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway. The victim, 
who was not named, was in moderate condition, it added. 
	 The army set up roadblocks and searched surrounding  
Palestinian villages for the attackers. It later said troops 
arrested six residents of Biddu village and that a curfew had 
been imposed on the village of Qatannah. 
	 Tensions between Israel and the Palestinians have been high  
since Israel began building a new Jewish settlement in Arab East 
Jerusalem in March, plunging peacemaking into deep crisis. 
	 Palestinians say settlement building in Jerusalem pre-empts  
final peace talks that are to be held covering issues including 
the status of Jerusalem. They want Arab East Jerusalem as 
capital of a future state. 
	 Israel vows never to cede any part of the city. It captured  
East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and in move 
unrecognised by the international community annexed it.
