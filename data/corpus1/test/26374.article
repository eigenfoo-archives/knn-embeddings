Annan on Friday told UN peacekeepers who patrol the Kuwaiti-Iraqi 
border that the United Nations may increase Iraq's embargo exemption 
to let it sell more oil. 
   "We are reviewing the scheme. We are going to make it much more  
effective and much more efficient ... including the possibility of 
increasing the volume of oil sold," he said during a trip to UN 
operations on the border. 
   Annan was referring to the UN oil-for-food pact under which  
Baghdad can sell crude worth two billion dollars every six months to 
pay for food, medicine and war reparations. 
   Iraq has been under an oil embargo since it invaded Kuwait in  
August 1990, while the oil-for-food arrangement, the first partial 
easing of the sanctions, went into force in December 1996. 
   Annan's arrival coincided with that of UN disarmament chief  
Richard Butler in Baghdad at the start of a four-day mission to 
convince Iraq to open all sites for inspection. 
   Annan said Butler would be discussing with Iraq "the need for  
them (the UN inspectors) to be given unfettered (eds: correct) 
access to wherever they believe their work should take them." 
   The UN chief said the United Nations will continue its  
disarmament work "despite the temporary difficulties we have in Iraq 
to ensure that the work is completed, that disarmament is completed, 
and Iraq is not a threat to Kuwait nor to the region nor to anyone 
else." 
   He said there is no guarantee that the Iraqis will be more  
cooperative with the UN Special Commission (UNSCOM) on eliminating 
Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction, "but they have changed their 
minds in the past." 
   "I will not exclude a positive outcome when Mr Butler sits down  
with them (the Iraqis)," he said. 
   Annan, who toured the UN-patrolled demilitarized zone (DMZ) on  
the border, was welcomed by a Bangladeshi band of bagpipers and 
drummers as he landed at Camp Khor aboard a UN helicopter from the 
Kuwaiti capital. 
   His visit was part of efforts "to reassure the Kuwaiti people of  
the international community's determination that peace prevails in 
Kuwait and the region," he told journalists when he arrived in 
Kuwait from Iran. 
   Camp Khor, the main UNIKOM camp on the Kuwaiti side of the DMZ  
near Umm Qasr on Iraq's side, is where the 1,084-strong military 
mission has its headquarters. 
   The force was set up after the Gulf War to patrol the DMZ and  
ensure no unauthorised personnel or weapons enter the zone. 
   In April, the number of unarmed military observers in UNIKOM was  
reduced from 230 to 194, to cut costs. Kuwait meets two-thirds of 
UNIKOM's annual budget of 52 million dollars. 
   The bulk of the multi-national force is made up of a Bangladeshi  
mechanized infantry battalion of 765 soldiers and 125-strong support 
units from Argentina, Austria and Germany. 
   UNIKOM monitors a 200-kilometre (125-mile) land border and  
40-kilometre (25-mile) border at sea. On land, the DMZ extends five 
kilometres (three miles) into Kuwait and 10 kilometres (six miles) 
inside Iraq. 
   Kuwait, which has captured several Iraqi infiltrators mainly  
seeking to escape economic hardship in their sanctions-hit country, 
has been building an electrified fence on its side. 
   The heavily-fortified border already comprises a series of sand  
berms and ditches, built after the Gulf War which rolled back a 
seven-month Iraqi occupation of the emirate. 
   Annan is to meet the emir, Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah, and  
the crown prince and prime minister, Sheikh Saad al-Abdallah 
al-Salim al-Sabah, before leaving Kuwait on Sunday.
