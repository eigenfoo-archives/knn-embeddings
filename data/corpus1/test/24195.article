regions were warned Monday to move out of flood-prone areas in 
the path of Typhoon Linda, which was moving west after raking 
southern Vietnam at the weekend. 
	  As many as 200 fishermen were feared drowned after Linda  
sunk their boats off Vietnam's southern tip, a Red Cross 
official in Kien Giang provice said. 
	 Typhoon Linda, which hit Vietnam Sunday with winds of up to  
63 miles an hour, had sunk at least 1,000 boats and destroyed 
more than 2,000 houses in Kien Giang, the official said. 
	``This is the worst storm we have seen for 40 years,'' the  
official said. 
	 Most of the boats foundered off the southern Vietnamese  
islands of Phu Quoc and Kian Hai. 
	 The official Evening News said 15 people were missing, nine  
had been injured and more than 12,000 houses had collapsed in Ca 
Mau, Vietnam's southernmost province. 
	 Meanwhile, two other major storms were on the move after  
wreaking havoc elsewhere on the Pacific Rim. 
	 Super-typhoon Keith, after pounding the Northern Mariana  
Islands, was moving west-northwest across the Pacific Monday 
while Cyclone Martin churned on after flattening some parts of 
the remote Cook Islands in the South Pacific. 
	 The National Weather Center in Hanoi said Typhoon Linda had  
entered the Gulf of Thailand and was moving west at 12 miles per 
hour with winds of over 90 km an hour at its core. 
	 Disaster Management Unit, a United Nations-sponsored  
disaster relief agency, said in an initial report that so far 
only six people were confirmed dead and 40 missing. 
	 However, it said 1,158 boats were missing off the coasts of  
seven provinces, excluding Kien Giang, and 1,158 acres of rice 
fields had been flooded in Bac Lieu province. 
	 As Linda was due to hit Thailand's southern coastal  
provinces Monday night, disaster relief officials warned people 
living in the area to move out of flood-prone areas. 
	 Eight years ago, Typhoon Gay wreaked havoc on Thailand's  
southern coast. Local officials had claimed that up to 500 
people, mostly fishermen, died from floods and rough seas when 
it hit on November 4, 1989. 
	 Unocal Thailand, a unit of U.S. oil and gas company Unocal  
Corp, lost 91 employees when a gas-drilling platform collapsed 
as Gay hit. 
	 The company said Monday it had evacuated 720 people from its  
oil drilling platforms in the Gulf of Thailand. 
	 Keith destroyed several buildings and caused flooding in  
coastal areas of the Marianas Sunday but there were no reports 
of casualties, U.S. officials said Monday. 
	 Keith's winds gusted at up to 100 mph when the storm passed  
over the Marianas but winds at its center were about 230 mph, 
William Carwile, director of the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency in Guam, said by telephone. 
	 Keith was heading west-northwest across the Pacific, U.S.  
officials said. 
	 But in Manila, government forecaster Susan Hingpit said  
Keith was still 2,000 km away from the typhoon-prone Philippines 
and could miss the country entirely. 
	 Twenty-two people were reported missing after Cyclone Martin  
hit the Cook Islands Friday morning and officials said several 
people might have been swept away by high seas. 
	 A statement from the Cook Islands government said reports  
indicated that about 90 percent of property had been destroyed 
on Manihiki and Rakahanga, two tiny atolls on the South Pacific 
nation's northern fringe. 
	 Inspector Richard Brown of the Hurricane Information Center  
on Rarotonga said the cyclone was moving in a southeasterly 
direction through the southern Cooks about 140 miles from 
Rarotonga, the main island. He said the cyclone could move east 
and avoid the island, but an alert remained in force. 
	 New Zealand will fly a planeload of aid to the Cook Islands,  
Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said Monday.
