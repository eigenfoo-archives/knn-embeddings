      KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 16 (AFP) - China, vowing to be a "good  
neighbour" in an historic summit Tuesday with Southeast Asia, 
disavowed the use of force in regional disputes and assured nervous 
markets it would not devalue its currency. 
   "China will never seek hegemony. China will always be a staunch  
force in maintaining regional and global peace and stability," 
President Jiang Zemin told counterparts from the Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). 
   The nine ASEAN members held successive meetings with Jiang,  
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and South Korean Prime 
Minister Koh Kun one day after all 12 countries took part in an 
unprecedented East Asian summit against the backdrop of regional 
financial turmoil. 
   "China will forever be a good neighbour, a good partner and a  
good friend with ASEAN countries," Jiang said in a speech to leaders 
of Brunei, Burma, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, 
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. 
   The speech, stressing themes of "mutual trust" and "common  
ground," addressed suspicions about China's ambitions following 
confrontations with ASEAN members over the disputed Spratly islands 
in the South China Sea. 
   "There is no tension in the South China Sea," Chinese Foreign  
Minister Qian Qichen told a news conference after the summit, 
describing the disputes as an "historic legacy". 
   While no agreement was reached on regular summits, Qian said  
another meeting could be held next year "if necessary." 
   A joint China-ASEAN statement vowed they would resolve any  
disputes "through peaceful means, without resorting to the threat or 
use of force." 
   "The parties concerned agreed to resolve their disputes in the  
South Cina Sea through friendly consultations and negotiations in 
accordance with universally recognised international law, including 
the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea," the joint statement 
said. 
   "While continuing efforts to find solutions, they agreed to  
explore ways for cooperation in the areas concerned," the statement 
said.  They promised to "to continue to exercise self-restraint and 
handle relevant differences in a cool and constructive manner." 
   ASEAN and China also backed development of the Mekong River  
basin which encompasses poor Indochinese states. 
   Jiang also assured ASEAN leaders that China would not devalue  
its currency and instead use other means of boosting its exports. 
   A yuan devaluation could put further pressure on ASEAN  
currencies, which are trading around all-time lows, because it would 
make Chinese exports comparatively cheaper. 
   Foreign minister Qian said "China will not subsidize its  
exports" and competitiveness will be boosted by improving the 
quality of products, cutting costs and expanding trade. 
   He said foreign investment, a key factor in a currency's  
strength, "will keep coming in" because of the good environment in 
China. 
   Jiang urged the two sides to give priority to economic relations  
as well as trade, scientific and technological cooperation, and 
called for broader exchanges with ASEAN "in all areas, at all 
levels, and through all channels." 
   Jiang said that as the world's largest developing country, China  
needs "a long-term peaceful international environment and a good 
neighbourly environment in particular" to modernize. 
   Even a developed China would adhere to peaceful co-existence,  
amity and mutual respect, said Jiang, who predicted his country 
would be "strong, prosperous, democratic and culturally advanced" by 
the mid-21st century.
