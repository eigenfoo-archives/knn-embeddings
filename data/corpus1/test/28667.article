	 SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - With Unabomber suspect  
Theodore Kaczynski found mentally competent, Judge Garland 
Burrell on Tuesday delayed deciding whether he can represent 
himself until moments before his trial could resume. 
	 Burrell said the question of representation would be decided  
in open court between 8 and 10 a.m. PST Thursday. He has told 
jurors in the case, who have not yet been sworn in, to be ready 
for possible opening statements at 10 a.m. PST Thursday. 
	 Burrell said Tuesday that ``currently I'm not inclined to  
bring in new lawyers'' and ``the question centers on self- 
representation.'' 
	 Kaczynski, a one-time math professor at the University of  
California, Berkeley, is charged with waging a 17-year bombing 
campaign against technology targets that killed three people and 
injured 29. 
	 As Tuesday's hearing began, defense and prosecution  
attorneys said they accepted the conclusions of federal 
psychiatrist Sally Johnson, who after five days of testing 
submitted a 47-page report saying Kaczynski met the legal 
standard for mental competency. 
	 In a cover letter for the sealed report filed with the U.S.  
District Court clerk late Tuesday, Johnson said: 
	 ``It is my opinion, that despite the psychiatric diagnoses  
described in the attached report, Mr. Kaczynski is not suffering 
from a mental disease or defect rending him mentally incompetent 
to the extent that he is unable to understand the nature and 
consequences of the proceedings filed against him or to assist 
his attorneys in his defense.'' 
	 Johnson did not say whether she meant her own psychiatric  
diagnoses or those of other experts included in the report. 
	 Burrell said the Sixth Amendment guaranteed criminal  
defendants the right to effective counsel but with a 
court-appointed defense, ``the defendant has no absolute right 
to fire his lawyer.'' 
	 There was considerable discussion about whether Kaczynski  
had agreed in private talks with defense lawyers and Burrell 
Dec. 22 that his lawyers would present non-expert evidence on 
his mental status in the guilt phase of the trial. 
	 Non-expert evidence could include ``soft'' displays such as  
photographs; Kaczynski's Montana cabin; and testimony from lay 
witnesses, including his 80-year-old mother and his younger 
brother, both present in court Tuesday. 
	 Defense lawyers Quin Denvir and Judy Clarke say that in the  
face of overwhelming government evidence, Kaczynski can only be 
saved from the death penalty by a ``mental defect'' defense. 
	 Burrell said he would reread the documents and decide  
whether edited portions of the Dec. 22 discussion can be 
released, as the prosecution wants. 
	 ``The statements by Mr. Kaczynski during this proceeding  
could be used by the government in its attempt to kill him,'' he 
said. ``That's a deadly serious matter. You can understand why 
the defense wants to keep it from the government.'' 
	 After an apparent suicide attempt two weeks ago, Kaczynski  
asked to fire his lawyers and represent himself. 
	 The Justice Department earlier rejected a bargain in which  
Kaczynski would have pleaded guilty and served life in prison 
without parole, but it said last week it would be open to new 
plea negotiations if he was found competent. 
	 Legal analysts said it appeared Burrell was struggling to  
keep the defense team and to work out a defense strategy 
acceptable to both the defendant and the public defenders. 
	 Meanwhile, the defense asked that prosecutors be compelled  
to release information about ``secret shacks'' Kaczynski 
allegedly built in Montana. A hearing on the subject will be 
held  Wednesday. 
	 The government responded that the defense was seeking  
information ``uniquely in the defendant's possession, since only 
Kaczynski knows the precise location of such 'secret shacks.'''
