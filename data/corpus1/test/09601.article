Thursday at NBC's world headquarters in Rockefeller Center 
stopped all local programming and shut down traffic in midtown 
Manhattan. 
	 The five alarm fire began about 4 a.m. EDT in a 10th floor  
electrical closet near where construction was being performed 
and caused the evacuation of the 70-story General Electric Co. 
building, NBC said. 
	 Officials said the fire was still burning on at least five  
floors and firefighters were trying to find its source and 
isolate it. 
	 Local news programming at WNBC-TV has been affected but the  
network's Today Show, with studios in a separate building across 
the street from 30 Rockefeller Centre, was able to go on the 
air. 
	 A handful of employees were treated for smoke inhalation,  
the Today Show said. 
	 The GE building is also home to the network's Nightly News  
programme and a number of other programs are taped there, 
including Late Night With Conan O'Brien and the Rosie O'Donnell 
show. 
	 New York fire officials say the fire has been brought under  
control, but people who work in the building are not being 
allowed to enter. Officials say they don't know when it will be 
safe to let the workers in.
