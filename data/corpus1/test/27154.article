the Islamic radical group HAMAS held a rally here Wednesday, during 
which militants blew up a mock model of a Jewish settlement, 
witnesses said. 
   Some 2,500 people attended the rally staged by the Islamic  
Resistance Movement (HAMAS) in the Jenin refugee camp in the West 
Bank to mark the 10th anniversary of the founding of the movement. 
   The gathering was kicked off by a "military parade" of jeeps  
bearing HAMAS slogans and driven by militants wearing 
Mujahedeen-style green headbands marked "No God but God," the basic 
creed of Islam, witnesses said. 
   A group of masked youths used fireworks to blow up a small-scale  
cardboard model of a Jewish settlement and set fire to the remains, 
the witnesses said. 
   HAMAS has rejected Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's  
negotiations with Israel and has waged a three-year campaign of 
violence which has killed scores of Israelis. 
   But the movement's spiritual leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, called  
on his followers to avoid confrontation with Arafat's Palestinian 
Authority, which is negotiating a US-brokered security accord with 
Israel which would commit it to uprooting the group's armed wing. 
   "We are committed to maintaining our people's unity in the face  
of Israeli and American attempts to fragment us and we will not 
allow conspiracies to divide the Palestinians," Yassin said in a 
phone call broadcast to the crowd. 
   "We tell the authority, stay strong and firm in the face of  
outside pressures," he said. 
   He dismissed condemnations of HAMAS as a terrorist group, saying  
HAMAS "are not terrorists. We are fighting an enemy who has stolen 
our land. We are the victims of Zionist terrorism," he said. 
   HAMAS was due to hold a similar rally in Gaza City last Friday  
but cancelled it after Palestinian police briefly detained several 
of its members as they hung up signs advertising the event. 
   HAMAS officials said the rally was cancelled due to heavy rains  
that day in Gaza, not because of the detentions, and said the rally 
would be held this coming Friday.
