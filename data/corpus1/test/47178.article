200 warplanes, mostly US fighters and bombers based in Italy, to hit 
possible targets in Serbia which has fewer than 80 at its disposal. 
   The NATO warplanes are equipped with either cruise missiles or  
air-to-ground assault missiles, and with air-to-air defence 
missiles. 
   The western alliance decided Wednesday to beef up its resources  
in the region, sending the aircraft-carrier USS Enterprise and eight 
other NATO warships into the Adriatic which they should reach some 
time in the next few days. 
   The allied warships and submarines in the Mediterranean and  
Adriatic are also equipped to fire cruise missiles, which would play 
a leading role in the early stages of an allied intervention as they 
would remove the need to risk the lives of pilots overflying Serbian 
targets. 
   The degree of alert at the Italian airbases was reduced  
Wednesday from 96 to 48 hours. 
   The air-fleet includes long-range B-2 Stealth bombers, several  
F-15 and F-16 fighters, and a variety of planes for purposes ranging 
from refuelling to radar-scrambling. 
   Other contributors include France, which is sending 10  
warplanes, Britain, which has deployed four fighter-bombers and a 
refuelling plane, the Netherlands and Germany. 
   Eight German fighter-bombers, Tornado-ECRs specialized in  
finding and destroying anti-aircraft batteries, left for Italy on 
Thursday, the defense ministry in Bonn said. 
   Denmark said it would send four F-16's later in the week, and  
Belgium announced Thursday that it would be sending six F-16 
fighter-bombers to Italy "in the next few hours." 
   At the time of the last Kosovo crisis in October 1998, NATO had  
around 430 warplanes ready for possible intervention. 
   By contrast, the Yugoslav air force has 79 Russian-built MiG  
warplanes as well as a broad air-defense network with surface-to-air 
missiles (SAM), according to the International Institute for 
Strategic Studies in London. 
   The Serbs have eight SAM batteries at eight different sites, and  
their arsenal includes at least 100 SAM with a range of 2-16 
kilometers (1-10 miles), the IISS said. 
   Their SAM 6 has been upgraded recently and Belgrade is believed  
to have linked its air-defense network with a similar one in ethnic 
Serb-ruled areas of Bosnia to detect any NATO air raids as early as 
possible. 
   Following a possible intervention, NATO military experts believe  
the implementation of a ceasefire in Kosovo would require land 
forces of 26,000 men and the prior approval of Belgrade. 
   The figure is considered politically sensitive by NATO diplomats  
who have asked their military colleagues to find ways of revising it 
downwards. 
   NATO is already heavily committed in Bosnia-Hercegovina, where  
it has 30,000 troops policing a police treaty, and NATO sources say 
that the winter conditions would make the deployment of even more 
troops in the Balkans an extremely delicate exercise.
