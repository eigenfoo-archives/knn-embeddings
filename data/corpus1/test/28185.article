Algeria left at least 103 dead and 70 injured, security officials 
said Monday, as traumatised locals continued to haul bodies out of 
the rubble of this small village near Algiers. 
   In a rare move that reflected growing pressure on the Algerian  
authorities to halt the recent upsurge in atrocities, the security 
forces put out a communique detailing their response to the killings 
overnight Sunday in Sid Hamed. 
   The communique, which described 10 of the wounded as being in a  
serious condition, argued that the death toll would have been far 
higher but for resistance by self-defence groups and the swift 
intervention of the security forces after they were alerted. 
   Survivors at the scene said at least 120 people were slain in  
the massacre, while more bodies were still being pulled Monday 
morning from ruined houses. 
   Weeping residents stepped over pools of blood, striking matches  
to peer into the rubble for the buried corpses of men, women and 
children who had been shot or hacked to death with spades and axes. 
   Stressing that the massacre had been carried out by "a terrorist  
group," the security communique said the attack had begun with a 
home-made bomb blast in a cafe in the village, which "left several 
dead and injured." 
   Five "terrorists" were killed and several others wounded in a  
shoot-out that claimed the lives of two security personnel, and two 
local self-defence volunteers, it added. 
   Set back from the main road linking Meftah and Larbaa, and  
located 30 kilometers (20 miles) south of the capital, Sidi Hamed is 
little more than a group of small houses and brick huts clinging to 
the foothills of nearby mountains. 
   The daily Liberte said "dozens of families" were wiped out  
during the attack, which it described as the biggest such massacre 
so near the capital since the start of the Moslem holy month of 
Ramadan on December 30. 
   The capital's Zmirli and Mustapha hospitals were swamped with  
wounded overnight and extra doctors were called in to handle the 
emergency. 
   About 30 of the wounded, mostly children, adolescents and women,  
were operated on at the Mustapha hospital, an AFP correspondent who 
went to the hospital said. 
   Two of the wounded died there overnight from their injuries.  
   Survivors said the assault began after the evening meal marking  
the end of the daily fast that Moslem's observe throughout the 
Ramadan period. 
   "They attacked several places at the same time, and we could  
hear screams and shooting," said one old woman who pointed out a 
blood-soaked area where people had been shot and had their throats 
cut. 
   The newspaper La Tribune said the massacre took place after a  
bomb exploded at a mosque at the end of the evening prayer with the 
assailants butchering victims as they tried to flee. 
   At the Mustapha hospital, a 12-year-old boy, Hamid, his face  
swollen, was suffering from a gunshot in the heel. 
   He told AFP he was at a video store watching a film Sunday  
evening with other residents when "men stormed in and began shooting 
after throwing a bomb." 
   Several newspapers said at least 54 people were killed at the  
weekend in a series of other ambush attacks. 
   El Watan said 11 people had their throats slit Saturday in the  
region of Bouira, 100 kilometers (60 miles) southeast of Algiers, 
ahead of a visit there by Interior Minister Mostefa Benmansour. The 
minister attended the funeral of the victims on Sunday after 
reviewing the security forces in the region. 
   The latest massacres are part of an upsurge in atrocities that  
the military-backed government blames on extremists who have been at 
war with the authorities since the cancellation in January 1992 of 
elections that the Islamic Salvation Front was poised to win. 
   The administration of President Lamine Zeroual agreed last week  
under intense international pressure over the killings to a visit by 
a troika of European Union delegates from Austria, Britain and 
Luxembourg. 
   But the government barred the mission from conducting any  
inquiry into the massacres, which it insists are an internal 
matter. 
   The planned visit represents the first initiative by the EU to  
get involved in the six-year-old conflict in the north African 
state, which has claimed an estimated 80,000 lives.
