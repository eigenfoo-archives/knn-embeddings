second term as president of Croatia when nearly 4 million voters decide 
among three candidates in balloting supervised by the Organization for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe. 
	The 75-year-old Tudjman cast his ballot Sunday and said the election  
would ``continue consolidating (our) democracy.'' 
	The country's 7,558 voting stations were scheduled to close at 1700  
GMT (1 p.m. EST) with the first unofficial results expected to be 
announced Monday morning. 
	Opposing Tudjman are Social Democrat Zdravko Tomac and Vlado Gotovac,  
of the Social Liberals. They hoped to force a runoff by splitting the 
votes so that Tudjman would not get an absolute majority. 
	In the 1992 presidential elections, Tudjman polled 56.7 per cent of  
the vote.
