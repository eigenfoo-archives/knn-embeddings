of kidnapping and baby stealing under Argentina's military 
dictatorship surrendered Tuesday to authorities, police said. 
   Jorge "Tiger" Acosta turned himself in after refusing to answer  
a December 15 summons from an investigating judge probing the theft 
of babies born to political prisoners during Argentina's 1976-1983 
dictatorship. 
   A warrant was issued for his arrest after he refused to appear.  
Acosta, 56, could be the first of the string of former officers 
arrested in connection with baby-stealing to be put behind bars. 
   Acosta turned himself in to naval authorities, who immediately  
discharged him from the military, officials said. Upon appearing in 
court, Acosta was examined for hypertension, but authorities said 
that would not affect the investigation. 
   Other accused officers are in their 70s, so the sentencing judge  
allowed them to serve their sentences house arrest. 
   Acosta's surrender followed the arrest on Monday of retired  
Argentine admiral Ruben Franco in connection with the probe. 
   Investigating judge Adolfo Bagnasco questioned Franco, suspected  
to be the leader of the baby-stealing ring, before ordering his 
arrest and placing him under house detention, police said. 
   Bagnasco has already ordered detention for former Argentine  
dictators Jorge Videla and Emilio Massera in connection with the 
case, along with two retired admirals and a former Coast Guard 
officer. 
   The judge has conducted a two-year investigation into  
baby-stealing cases, at the request of the families of people who 
died or disappeared in military captivity during the "dirty war" 
from 1976 to 1983, in which the armed forces waged war against real 
and suspected insurgents. 
   Baby-stealing is one of the few crimes not covered by an amnesty  
granted at the end of the Argentine dictatorship. 
   Franco, who benefited from a 1986 amnesty law, rose to become  
top Navy commander during the military dictatorship. 
   Under his command, the Navy School of Mechanics (ESMA) was  
turned into a torture center where some 5,000 suspected leftists 
were held, many of which have never been found. ESMA was also where 
a clandestine maternity ward operated. 
   Pregnant prisoners were kept alive there and killed after giving  
birth. Their children were given up for adoption, usually by 
families of military personnel or police. Many baby-stealing cases 
have been traced to the facility. 
   Acosta was the school's intelligence chief and in charge of  
picking prisoners for weekly flights during which they were thrown 
alive into the ocean. 
   Bagnasco's investigation determined that at least 15 births took  
place at ESMA's clandestine maternity ward, and several more at the 
Central Military Hospital at the Campo de Mayo military base outside 
Buenos Aires. 
   Since investigations began into the thousands of people who  
disappeared during the military regime, 61 children stolen from 
political prisoners have been identified and located by the Plaza de 
Mayo Grandmothers. 
   Eight of the children died in the years following the  
dictatorship, 14 had been adopted under normal procedures. The other 
39 children regained their real identities and most are now living 
with their biological parents. 
   The organization, which for years has been investigating the  
disappearance of at least 10,000 and up to 30,000 people during the 
past military regime, estimates that some 400 stolen children have 
yet to be found and identified. 
   A Swedish woman, Damar Hagelin, was also held at ESMA. Her  
father last year told reporters he would follow Acosta's trail "like 
the Nazi's, until the end of his days." 
   Acosta was also accused of ordering the abduction of two French  
nuns, Leonie Duquet and Alice Dumon.
