ignoring an assassination threat, appealed Saturday for 
tolerance in Bosnia only hours after police removed explosives 
planted on his motorcade route into the capital Sarajevo. 
	 The Roman Catholic leader, prevented from visiting the  
Bosnian capital during the war because Serbs refused to 
guarantee his safety, arrived at Sarajevo airport amid tight 
security enforced by police and NATO soldiers. 
	 During the morning, police dismantled 23 anti-tank mines  
attached to a remote control system under a main boulevard. 
Bosnian police said the mines were probably planted overnight. 
	 There was no indication of who was responsible for the  
apparent assassination plot. 
	 Chief Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said five  
helicopters at the airport had been ready to take the pope to a 
ceremony at the main cathedral instead of allowing him to travel 
in his glass-topped popemobile. 
	 ``The pope said: 'No, I wouldn't even think of it'. He  
wanted to take the popemobile because it was important to see 
the people,'' Navarro-Valls said. 
	 In chilly wintry weather, the pope shook hands with the  
Muslim and Croat members of the new collective presidency before 
delivering an emotional call for reconciliation. 
	 ``It is here, from the spiritual foundations of human  
coexistence, that a new beginning must be made,'' he said. 
	 ``Never again war! Never again hatred and intolerance!...The  
inhuman logic of violence must be replaced by the constructive 
logic of peace. The natural instinct for revenge must yield to 
the liberating power of forgiveness.'' 
	 The pope, 76, has been an outspoken supporter of Bosnian  
statehood, decrying the nationalistic hatred that fueled the 
fighting between Catholic Croats, Bosnian Muslims and Orthodox 
Christian Serbs. 
	 He often mourned Sarajevo's plight during the 1992-95 war,  
when besieging Serb forces pounded the city with shellfire. 
	 ``From the first shot fired, and as soon as the first  
victims fell, your voice echoed with a call of condemnation. 
That voice continues to be heard,'' Alija Izetbegovic, Muslim 
chairman of Bosnia's collective presidency, told the pope. 
	 He praised the pope's 25-hour visit as an act of ``personal  
bravery and deep belief.'' 
	 The pope arrived at the cathedral to the sound of church  
bells as a NATO helicopter flew overhead and Italian anti-sniper 
units stood on the roofs of surrounding buildings. 
	 He spent 10 minutes greeting people waiting outside the  
church. A group of nuns wept as he blessed them. 
	 In the cathedral, where shrapnel holes in stain-glassed  
windows behind the altar still serve as a reminder of the war, 
the pope spoke of Sarajevo as ``this martyr city.'' 
	 He said Bosnia was ``still scarred by a violent and crazed  
logic of death, division and annilhilation.'' 
	 His visit coincided with a time of tense relations inside  
Bosnia's Muslim-Croat Federation and political paralysis in the 
peacetime central government. 
	 A wave of bomb attacks on churches and mosques over the past  
two months had raised fears for his safety. NATO soldiers 
outnumbered dignitaries at the airport ceremony, reflecting 
elaborate the security measures. 
	 As NATO helicopters buzzed overhead, the popemobile drove  
down the boulevard where police had removed the explosives and 
along what was Sniper Alley, Sarajevo's deadliest street during 
the siege. 
	 The mood was subdued with a small crowd lining the route to  
the city center and waving yellow and white Vatican banners. 
	 No senior Serb officials attended the airport ceremony,  
reflecting the Serbs' hostility to the Vatican. Serb leaders 
object to its early recognition of Croatia and Bosnia after the 
republics broke away from old Yugoslavia.
