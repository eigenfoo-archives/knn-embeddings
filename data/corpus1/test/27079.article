mastermind Carlos ``the Jackal'' on Wednesday to life in prison 
for killing two French secret agents and a Lebanese fellow 
revolutionary in 1975. 
	 The 48-year-old Venezuelan revolutionary, blamed for more  
than 80 deaths and hundreds of injuries during his 
pro-Palestinian struggle in the 1970s and 1980s, was found 
guilty of murder with aggravating circumstances. 
	 Carlos shouted ``Long live the revolution'' when the verdict  
was read shortly after 1 a.m. local time on Wednesday and added 
something else which was not heard distinctly. 
	 One journalist suggested the Marxist gunman may have added  
``Allah Ahkbar'' (God is Great) in Arabic but others present 
disputed this. 
	 Carlos, whose real name is Illich Ramirez Sanchez, was  
captured in Sudan in 1994 after two decades on the run and 
smuggled to France in a sack. 
	 He was retried for the three killings after receiving a life  
sentence in absentia five years ago. 
	 Carlos, once the swaggering star of international urban  
guerrillas, was charged with killing agents of the DST counter 
espionage organization agents Jean Donatini and Raymond Dous on 
June 27, 1975, in an apartment on rue Toullier in Paris's Latin 
Quarter. 
	 Michel Moukharbal, a Lebanese man known to Carlos as a  
fellow Palestinian sympathizer, was also killed in the shooting, 
while a third DST agent was seriously wounded. 
	 Prosecutors said Carlos shot the four men, none of whom was  
armed, after concluding that Moukharbal informed on him and then 
led the agents to him. 
	 The jury deliberated on the sentence for nearly three hours  
after a final, sometimes incoherent statement by Carlos to the 
court which rambled on for close to four hours. 
	 ``You can sentence me to life imprisonment, it does not  
frighten me,'' he said at one point. 
	 Playing to a handful of ``fans'' among the spectators, he  
asked: ``Do you hear me well ?'' When they shouted back ``No,'' 
he asked for another microphone. 
	 Carlos described the trial against him as ``rotten'' but  
skirted the issue of whether he was guilty of the shootings. ``I 
don't confirm or deny anything. I'm not an informer,'' he said. 
	 He praised the Palestinian cause and denounced Israel as  
``the number one terrorist state in history.'' 
	 ``When one wages war for 30 years, there is a lot of blood  
spilled -- mine and others. But we never killed anyone for money 
but for a cause -- the liberation of Palestine,'' he said. 
	 Prosecutor Gino Necchi argued on Monday that the evidence  
fully supported a guilty verdict and urged the jury to send 
Carlos to prison for the rest of his life. 
	 In his address, Carlos boasted that his exploits on behalf  
of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) had 
brought ``hundreds of millions of dollars'' to the Palestinian 
resistance. 
	 He denounced ``world Zionism'' as ``the enemy'' which would  
bring about ``the McDonalds-ization of humanity.'' 
	 Police say three witnesses described Carlos's role in the  
shootings to them within hours of the event, although none of 
the three could be found for the trial. 
	 The prosecution said Carlos boasted of the killings in  
letters to several friends, in a newspaper interview, in a 
telephone conversation with an associate who later wrote about 
their chat in a book and in conversations with diplomats seized 
during his most daring escapade -- the kidnapping of 11 oil 
ministers in Vienna later in 1975. 
	 But his lawyer Olivier Maudrut questioned why the witnesses  
could not now be found and why only a photograph was displayed 
of a key letter said to be in Carlos's hand. 
	 In that letter, prosecutors said, he wrote of sending  
Moukharbal ``to a better world'' for having betrayed him. 
	 ``A person cannot be condemned to life in prison based on a  
photocopy,'' Maudret said. 
	 At times angry and brimming with hate, at other times  
cracking jokes and poking fun at himself, Carlos took an active 
role in his own defense during the eight-day trial, frequently 
jumping to his feet with a sarcastic remark or to question a 
witness in his heavily Spanish-accented French. 
	 His trial is likely to be only the first step on a long  
judicial path. 
	 French anti-terror magistrate Jean-Louis Bruguiere is  
investigating him for three Paris bombings which killed five 
people in 1974 and 1982, a 1983 bombing which killed five in 
Marseille's train station and two bomb attacks on French trains 
in which seven people died in 1982 and 1983. 
	 He is also wanted in Germany for the bombing of Berlin's  
French cultural center, and in Austria for the 1975 kidnapping 
of the 11 OPEC oil ministers in Vienna.
