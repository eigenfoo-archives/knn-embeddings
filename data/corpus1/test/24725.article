the 230 people who died in the July 1996 crash of a TWA flight near 
New York that it had ended its criminal probe and ruled out 
terrorism as a cause, a victims' support group said Thursday. 
   Michel Breistroff, vice-president of an association set up by  
families of the victims, said the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
had sent a letter to families Wednesday officially informing them 
that the investigation was over. 
   "The FBI said that it was abandoning the criminal lead including  
the theory of a plot and that the probe was over," he said, adding 
that families had been aware of this for months and that the letter 
was just a formality. 
   Breistroff lost a 25-year-old son in the crash.  
   The head of the association, Jose Cremades, whose 15-year-old  
son was also on board the ill-fated Paris-bound flight, is expected 
in New York Sunday to meet with FBI officials over a report to be 
released later this month on the crash in the Atlantic off Long 
Island, New York. 
   Cremades said recently that the FBI has told the US Senate that  
the report would show US intelligence networks did not find a single 
reliable claim of responsibility from terrorist groups or 
sympathizers. 
   The FBI report will also note that no bomb or explosive residue  
was found in the wreckage recovered from the crash of the 
Paris-bound flight, according to media reports. 
   Breistroff said that the FBI findings mean that public hearings  
on airline crashes, scheduled for the beginning of December by the 
National Transportation Safety Board in Baltimore, Maryland, would 
take place as planned. 
   "We will have access to the (crash) file that will be given to  
us in the form of a CD-Rom," he said. "Families of victims unable to 
attend the hearings in Baltimore will also be given the CD-Rom." 
   Of the 230 people on board the TWA flight, 48 were French  
nationals. 
   The worldwide investigation cost the FBI 15 million dollars.  
   The National Transportation Safety Board has tentatively blamed  
the crash on a mechanical failure near the Boeing 747's fuel tanks.
