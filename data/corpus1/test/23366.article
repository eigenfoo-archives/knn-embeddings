polls on Sunday for Montenegro's run-off presidential elections, 
seen as crucial for this tiny Yugoslav republic. 
   Montenegrin state radio, quoting figures from polling stations  
around the country, reported overall turnout would be over 65 
percent. 
   The poll pits reformist premier Milo Djukanovic, 35, a fierce  
critic of Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic, against incumbent 
president Momir Bulatovic, 41. 
   Although colleagues in the same party, they are political foes  
diametrically opposed about which direction their tiny republic, 
which along with Serbia makes up rump Yugoslavia, should take. 
   Turnout became a key factor in the polls, after the Montenegrin  
electoral commission announced a 50 percent turnout was required for 
the vote to be valid. 
   Its ruling marked a departure from the generally accepted norm  
that the winning candidate in the second round of presidential 
elections is the one with the most votes, regardless of turnout. 
   The highest turnout appeared to be in northern towns of Kolasin  
and Andrijevica, as well as the southern Adriatic port Ulcinj -- 
where around 70 percent had voted by 6 p.m. (1600 GMT). 
   Voter-turnout was lower in the southern towns of Budva, Kotor  
and Herceg Novi, with less than 50 percent voting by the same time, 
the radio reported. 
   No major incidents were reported, but voters were still waiting  
to cast their ballots only an hour before the closure of polling 
stations at 8 p.m. (1800 GMT), the radio said. 
   Voting was slowed down by the requirement every voter should  
sign a register before casting his ballot, a move designed to reduce 
possible fraud during vote-counting. 
   The Montenegrin electoral commission said all voters who were at  
the polling station by that time, should be allowed to vote, 
Montenegrin television reported, meaning that voting would be 
extended for several hours. 
   The commission said unofficial preliminary results could be  
expected once more than 50 percent of the vote was counted, and some 
of its members estimated the figures could be announced early 
Monday. 
   "I did not expect that many people to come, especially not young  
ones," Ljubisa Stankovic, 71, a member of the voters' board in 
polling station 19, said. 
   Stankovic said that, compared with the first round, there were  
more voters in his polling station than on October 5 when overall 
turnout was 67.3 percent. 
   During the first round of the polls two weeks ago, Bulatovic won  
47.4 percent of the vote, against 46.7 percent for Djukanovic and 
the run-off is being held after neither candidate won an outright 
majority. 
   "Djukanovic managed to make many young people remember their  
right to vote. They finally understand that the vote can influence 
their future," Milan Popovic, a local journalist said. 
   The vote, which will elect a new president for a five-year term,  
gives Montenegrins a choice between greater autonomy for their 
republic within Yugoslavia -- the platform offered by Djukanovic -- 
or unconditional alliance with Serbia, as favoured by Bulatovic. 
   The last days of a hard-fought campaign were marked by a war of  
words between the two candidates who traded accusations of criminal 
activities and even arrests of a group from Serbia who travelled to 
Montenegro to help with Bulatovic's campaign.
