Sese Seko came home to Kinshasa Saturday where parliament filled 
the vacant post of his constitutional successor. 
	 At a meeting in Gabon with South Africa's Deputy President  
Thabo Mbeki, Mobutu agreed to talks Wednesday on board a South 
African ship with rebel leader Laurent Kabila, whose fighters 
are on the approaches to the capital. 
	 ``Both of them have agreed to meet Wednesday on the boat,''  
Mbeki told reporters in Gabon's capital Libreville on the latest 
step of a hectic diplomatic shuttle in the region. 
	 A first ship-borne session between the civil war foes hosted  
by South Africa's Nelson Mandela ended inconclusively last 
weekend in Congo. 
	 Zairian lawmakers voted Roman Catholic Archbishop Laurent  
Monsengwo to the position of speaker -- who under the 
transitional constitution takes over from the president in the 
event of his death or incapacity. 
	 ``He is not an alternative to either President Mobutu or  
Kabila,'' Christophe Lutundula, second deputy speaker of 
parliament said. 
	 ``We are hoping he will play a role as a national mediator  
and will persuade all sides to agree on a way of safeguarding 
the democratic process in Zaire.'' 
	 The vote, conducted by a show of hands, was marked by a  
prior walkout by the UDPS radical opposition party of Etienne 
Tshisekedi, and it was not clear whether a quorum was achieved. 
	 Bill Richardson, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said  
he still believed a peaceful transition in Zaire was possible 
but any new government would ``most likely'' be headed by Kabila 
in light of his military victories. 
	 He said the transitional phase should include various  
factions. ``The big issue is going to be how much of Mobutu's 
people, if any at all, are part of that,'' he said. 
	 Richardson also said a peaceful handover would require  
another face-to-face meeting between Kabila and Mobutu. 
	 Rebels said they had pushed Mobutu's army 30 miles beyond  
their previous outpost at Kenge, 125 miles east of Kinshasa in 
heavy fighting. It was not clear when the fighting took place. 
	 It was not possible to verify rebel claims, which in the  
past have often proved false. 
	 Kabila ruled out calling off his military drive, but  
confirmed he planned to meet Mobutu Wednesday for talks. 
	 ``No one has officially asked me to stop my offensive. We  
shall continue,'' Kabila said in an interview in Lubumbashi 
broadcast on French television LCI. 
	 Mobutu, 66, dominated the mineral-rich country at the heart  
of Africa for more than three decades until prostate cancer and 
the rebellion, launched in October, loosened his hold. 
	 In seven months, the rebels, initially a small force  
fighting for ethnic Tutsis, have won control of around three 
quarters of the vast country. 
	 Richardson warned Kabila to ensure his troops stopped  
mistreating Rwandan Hutu refugees and punished those responsible 
for alleged refugee massacres in eastern Zaire if he wanted 
respect from the international community. 
	 In Rwanda, U.N. investigators said they were leaving because  
Kabila's rebels had blocked their inquiry into reports of 
massacres of Rwandan Hutu refugees in eastern Zaire. 
	 A spokesman for the three-man U.N. mission to east Zaire  
said it and a five-member team of forensic experts had waited in 
Rwanda since last Saturday for rebel clearance to start work in 
Zaire but the rebels refused them access.
