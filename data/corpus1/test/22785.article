Hurricane Pauline lambasted Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo 
Saturday amid a chaotic relief effort and a discrepancy between 
the official and unofficial death tolls. 
	 Zedillo, who cut short a state visit to Germany, visited  
this devastated Pacific resort for the first time as homeless 
people mobbed aid centers, and rescue workers picked through the 
mud looking for more dead. 
	 While Zedillo kissed babies and hugged old ladies in front  
of news cameras at a relief center, other people shouted at him 
in frustration, complaining that help had not yet arrived 
although the killer storm passed through two days ago. 
	 ``What do you mean no?'' Zedillo asked, after being told  
that no aid had been received. ``Is there water?'' 
	 ``No!'' shouted the crowd.  
	 ``Are there clothes?'' the president asked.  
	 ``No!'' came the chorus, after which Zedillo stopped asking  
questions. 
	 There was also a big discrepancy between the official and  
unofficial death tolls. Interior Minister Emilio Chuayffet said 
there were 136 dead in the western state of Guerrero alone and 
some 300 people missing, private Radio Red reported. 
	 But the Mexican Red Cross had put the estimated death toll  
as high as 400, with 20,000 homeless, and the total looked 
likely to rise as the dead in remote communities were added to 
the mounting casualties. 
	 Weary rescue workers in Acapulco searched for dead with bare  
hands and shovels in deep mud washed down from the surrounding 
mountains, but didn't report finding any victims on Saturday. 
More bodies may have been washed out to sea, rescue workers 
said. 
	 The hurricane has been followed by a mounting political  
storm. During a raucous news conference Saturday, Zedillo and 
opposition politicians shouted at each other amid accusations by 
leftist lawmakers that the government did not warn people soon 
enough about the storm's approach. 
	 As other Cabinet ministers talked about the success of  
relief efforts, Felix Salgado of the leftist Party of the 
Democratic Revolution stood up and shouted: ``Mr. President, 
they are lying to you.'' 
	 Zedillo acknowledged that politics played a part in the  
tragedy, saying corrupt local officials had allowed scores of 
impoverished neighborhoods to remain perched dangerously on the 
sides of the mountains that surround the bay. 
	 ``I will not permit these homes to be rebuilt in the same  
places,'' Zedillo said. 
	 At relief centers, army soldiers frantically dispensed  
relief packages that included water, milk, cooking oil, canned 
food, rice and beans. 
	 At one center, more than 2,000 people gathered ankle deep in  
mud amid a swarm of flies and crying babies, desperately trying 
to get food after having gone a day or two without. At least one 
man passed out while waiting. 
	 ``We need help,'' Sofia Torres, 29, a homemaker, told  
Reuters. ``I have a family of four including a 4-month-old baby 
and they haven't eaten for a day,'' she said, crying. 
	 People begged reporters for water and food.  
	 During his visit, Zedillo promised the victims the  
government would spend whatever it took to help the victims and 
the city's lucrative tourist trade recover from the storm. 
	 ``Even though we have to cut our budget in other places, we  
will spend what it takes to repair the damage,'' Zedillo said. 
	 He told 6-year-old Carlos Gomez, ``Don't worry, we'll fix up  
your home.'' 
	 After visiting the people, Zedillo, wearing jeans, got a  
closer look at the destruction -- visiting a spot where the 
raging waters demolished nearly an entire city block. 
	 Despite the destruction, Zedillo pledged the resort would  
not be permanently soiled by the mud that still covered its 
streets. ``Acapulco is not destroyed. It will recover.'' 
	 Foreign tourists in high-rise hotels weathered the hurricane  
all right, but thousands of poor Mexicans living in makeshift 
homes in the hills above Acapulco's bay were plastered by 
flooding and mudslides. 
	 The storm eventually dissipated Friday after it moved inland  
and was cut off from its supply of sea water. 
	 South of Acapulco, poor villages along the coast did not  
fare much better. Major roads into the area were reopened on 
Saturday but many towns still lacked clean water, electricity 
and telephone service.
