tenacious wildfire that forced the evacuation of thousands of 
people from two southern California towns and continued to 
spread, burning more than 8,700 acres 
.
	 A second fire in the area, about 80 miles east of Los  
Angeles, sprang up overnight and was threatening a third 
community but no evacuations had been ordered there, officials 
said. 
	 The Riverside County Sheriff's Department urged people to  
evacuate the San Jacinto Mountain resorts of Idyllwild and Pine 
Cove Monday and ordered a forced evacuation of the towns Tuesday 
morning after flames licked to within 500 yards 
 of both communities. 
	 In Arizona, firefighters declared victory Tuesday over a  
huge blaze that scorched 50,000 acres near the north rim of the 
Grand Canyon. ``Things are winding down pretty well. It's a 
mopping-up operation now,'' said spokeswoman Peg Crim of the 
Arizona Interagency Fire Center. 
	 She said visitors would be able to spend the July 4  
Independence Day holiday at the north rim and at Jacob's Lake, a 
popular beauty spot and camping area that was temporarily closed 
by the blaze. 
	 The National Interagency Fire Center said 32 fires continued  
to burn in Alaska Tuesday but moist, cool weather was allowing 
rapid containment. 
	 In Idyllwild and Pine Cove, California, however, the fires  
chased virtually all residents away. ``There is no one left in 
there. Everyone is out,'' a Sheriff's Department spokeswoman 
said. A few residents had remained in their homes overnight but 
were ordered out early on Tuesday, she added. 
	 Officials estimated that about 5,000 people had fled the two  
towns. All roads into the area were blocked by police. 
	 The second fire, which threatened the small community of  
Reed Valley, burned 800 acres overnight, a spokesman for the 
Riverside Rangers office said. ``We are keeping a careful eye on 
it,'' he added. 
	 Bill Peters, a spokesman for the California Department of  
Forestry and Fire Protection, said more than 1,700 firefighters 
were battling the Idyllwild blaze in the San Bernardino National 
Forest, aided by 130 fire engines, 10 air tankers and 10 
helicopters. 
    About 90 fire engines were stationed in the two towns to  
protect properties. Peters said so far no structures had been 
lost. ``Four firemen have suffered minor injuries, which is 
really good for a fire like this,'' he said. 
	 Tinder dry conditions and brush that had not burned for 50  
years, combined with 100-degree temperatures, extremely low 
humidity and swirling, unpredictable winds were hampering 
firefighting efforts at the same time as they were fueling the 
blaze, Peters said. 
	 Firefighters also had to contend with steep, mountainous  
terrain which made access by vehicles impossible. 
	 The wildfire, which started Saturday, was believed to have  
been sparked by bullets from target shooters. 
	 A third California fire in the Angeles National Forest, 60  
miles (96 km) north of Los Angeles had burned 1,800 acres 
 by Tuesday morning but was expected to be brought under full 
control on Wednesday.
