worked out with Russia allowing U.N. arms monitors including 
Americans to return to Baghdad and resume inspections, 
apparently defusing a three-week-old crisis. 
	 As the United States pressed ahead with a military buildup  
in the Persian Gulf, Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations 
told the Security Council U.N. weapons inspectors could resume 
their work in Iraq. 
	 ``We think that the crisis is over. Today I delivered to the  
president of the Security Council the decision of the government 
of Iraq to invite UNSCOM (the U.N. special comission) back in 
its usual work, its usual teams and start working, effective 
today,'' Nizar Hamdoon told reporters. 
	 ``We have invited the UNSCOM and its entire membership,  
including Americans.'' 
	 Hamdoon praised Russia's mediation in the crisis. He said  
Moscow had promised to work to ensure that the arms inspections 
-- aimed at dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction under 
the 1991 Persian Gulf War cease-fire -- resulted in 
international sanctions against Iraq being lifted. 
	 In Washington, President Clinton said the United States was  
``resolute'' in its determination to make Iraq comply fully with 
U.N. mandates, and that it remained to be seen whether Saddam 
would allow inspectors full access. 
	 ``In the coming days we will wait and see whether he does in  
fact comply with the will of the international community,'' 
Clinton said. 
	 To underline U.S. skepticism, Pentagon officials said they  
would send 32 additional warplanes, including fighter jets and 
B-1 bombers, to the Persian Gulf region, along with Patriot 
anti-aircraft missile launchers to protect them. 
	 Six B-52 bombers and six F-117A radar-avoiding stealth  
fighters took off from U.S. bases to join the powerful U.S. air 
and naval force already poised near Iraq. 
	 Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler said the team  
including Americans would return to Baghdad from Bahrain Friday, 
``provided that what we've heard on the wire services is right, 
that Iraq really has decided this.'' 
	 The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Bill Richardson,  
told reporters: ``Iraq must now follow with real performance on 
the ground...There can be no conditions, no deals, no winks.'' 
	 The standoff began Oct. 29 when Iraq ordered the expulsion  
of American U.N. arms inspectors, whom it accused of espionage. 
The order was carried out last Thursday and most other U.N. 
inspectors left Friday. 
	 Washington and U.N. officials have accused Iraq of lying,  
obstructing inspections and hiding its weapons programs. 
	 World oil prices fell on news of the accord. Brent crude,  
the world benchmark grade, was down 43 cents at $18.75 a barrel 
at 2 p.m EDT, having mostly traded around $20 in recent weeks. 
	 The head of the Arab and International Committee of Iraq's  
parliament, Saad Qasim Hammoudi, told reporters Iraq had set 
conditions for the agreement. 
	 He said Russia would guarantee measures including ``balanced  
representation'' of U.N. Security Council members in UNSCOM and 
suspending inspection of presidential sites and flights of 
U.S.-operated U-2 spy planes used by the United Nations. 
	 A Russian-Iraqi statement was issued earlier in Baghdad and  
Moscow after a middle-of-the-night meeting in Geneva at which 
the world's major powers demanded that Iraq allow the inspectors 
to return unconditionally. 
	 Iraq's official news agency INA quoted the statement as  
saying Russia would contribute to a rapid lifting of sanctions, 
particularly on Iraq's oil exports. 
	 ``One must view current efforts by the Russian diplomacy as  
just the first stage of unblocking the situation. There is still 
much work to be done,'' Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Valery Nesterushkin told a news briefing later in Moscow. 
	 U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who flew nearly  
half way around the world from India to attend the Geneva 
meeting, told reporters: ``It appears that Saddam Hussein has 
reversed course and that the U.N. inspectors will be able to go 
in and do their work unconditionally.'' 
	 There has been strong opposition in the Arab world and  
beyond to using force in the dispute, seen as a test of whether 
the United Nations could operate successfully as world 
policeman. 
	 ``What this crisis has shown is that the permanent members  
of the Security Council and the other members are determined to 
have the will of the international community carried out,'' 
Albright said. 
	 She earlier said a discussion on speeding the lifting of  
sanctions was probable in future, but ``the United States has 
not agreed to anything'' as a condition for the agreement. 
	 She declared in March that even if Iraq did comply fully  
with disarmament conditions, sanctions should stay because 
Saddam would remain a constant threat. 
	 The Iraqi leadership's statement repeated denials concerning  
Baghdad's arsenal, saying: ``By God, there are not any chemical 
or biological weapons...and concerning the nuclear and missile 
weapons, the non-Iraqis concerned have affirmed that there are 
no such weapons in Iraq and their files should be closed down.'' 
	 Iraqi television said Saddam had declared Nov. 20 ``The Day  
of the People,'' to be marked every year to celebrate ``victory 
over the enemies and the covetous ones.'' 
	 The agreement followed a visit to Moscow by Iraqi Deputy  
Prime Minister Tareq Aziz and mediation by Russia's foreign 
minister and veteran Middle East expert, Yevgeny Primakov. 
	 In Cairo, Aziz said he had made no deal in Moscow but that  
Russia had promised to work toward a lifting of sanctions. 
	 The foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, Russia  
and France and a representative of China, the five permanent 
members of the Security Council, said in a statement after the 
Geneva talks that a meeting Friday of UNSCOM would discuss ways 
to make its work more effective. 
	 They made no mention of an end to sanctions or expansion of  
an oil-for-food deal under which Iraq can sell a limited amount 
of oil to buy food and medicine for its suffering people. 
	 France and Russia, both owed large debts by Iraq, are keen  
to have the embargo lifted so that they can benefit from 
lucrative oil deals and start to see repayments. 
	 French President Jacques Chirac thanked Yeltsin and Clinton  
for their role in helping to defuse the crisis, but France's 
Foreign Affairs Minister Hubert Vedrine said on Europe 1 radio: 
	 ``We must not give the impression, as the United States has  
over the past few years, that there would never be an end to the 
tunnel or a lifting of the embargo -- even if Iraqis fulfilled 
all their obligations, even if they dismantled all massive 
destruction programs.'' 
	 British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, whose country has been  
Washington's staunchest ally in the crisis, said the 
international community would remain vigilant until it was clear 
Iraq was developing no more powerful weapons. 
	 German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel welcomed Iraq's  
decision and praised Russian efforts to resolve the crisis. 
	 In Amman, Jordan, a U.S. humanitarian group called ``Voices  
in the Wilderness'' campaigning for an end to sanctions said it 
would leave for Baghdad Friday to deliver medical supplies in 
defiance of U.S. law. 
	 At the same time, Jordan's Islamist-dominated opposition  
condemned Washington for ``criminal policies'' against the Iraqi 
people and urged Arab governments to flout U.N. sanctions.
