global climate change conference here remained stuck over the role 
of developing countries that fiercely resist efforts to restrict 
their emissions. 
   A difficult search for a compromise is to begin this week when  
ministers from some 180 nations arrive in the Argentine capital for 
the second half of the meeting focusing on how to achieve cutbacks 
in global warming gases. 
   The UN Climate Change conference is to conclude Friday, and  
officials are looking for a consensus on a plan to implement the 
agreement of December 1997 in Kyoto, Japan, to cut emissions linked 
to climate change. 
   The deep division between the developed and developing worlds  
emerged almost immediately after the convention's start last week. 
   Some 132 developing nations last week categorically rejected an  
Argentine proposal that they voluntarily cut their "greenhouse" gas 
emission, primarily carbon dioxide generated by burning fossil 
fuels. 
   The clash between the developed world and the so-called G77 and  
China is far from over and casts doubt on the future of the Kyoto 
Protocol signed in Japan last year. 
   Under that agreement, developed countries agreed to binding cuts  
in greenhouse gas production. 
   Despite the rejection of the Argentine proposal, several members  
of this eclectic group are inclined to side with the developed 
world. Besides Argentina, they include Mexico, which already belongs 
to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. 
   But most wealthier developing nations are extremely reluctant to  
accept limits that could harm their economies. 
   At the conference, delegates also are expected to clash on the  
question of the three so-called "flexibility mechanisms" touted by 
the United States as a way to meet Kyoto's requirements and boost 
economic growth everywhere. 
   These mechanisms include "emissions trading" that would allow  
nations that have exceeded their cutbacks under the Kyoto agreement 
to sell allowances to nations that have not. 
   The European Union favors a limit on how much a country could  
use emissions trading and the two other tools -- joint 
implementation and the Clean Development Mechanism -- to meet its 
requirements. 
   "But there is also division among EU members as to the extent of  
the limitations, if any, that should be placed on emissions 
trading," said Mark Hambley, special US negotiator on climate 
change. 
   Environmental groups such as the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) for  
Nature say a cap on emissions trading is critical to preventing 
wealthy nations such as Canada, Japan and the United States from 
buying their way out of Kyoto by purchasing credits from countries 
like Russia and Ukraine. 
   Without caps, the Kyoto Protocol "could collapse like a  
souffle," warned Nick Mabey, head of economic policy for WWF in 
Britain. "A cap on emissions trading is a motor for technological 
innovation in industrialized countries, which is absolutely 
essential for fighting off global warming."
