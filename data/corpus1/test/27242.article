Baghdad's claim that the United States planned to drop bombs 
laced with biological or chemical weapons on Iraq as 
''ridiculous.'' 
	 ``We term this ridiculous,'' said a White House spokesman.  
''We do not have these weapons in our operational inventory.'' 
	 Earlier Friday, Iraqi leaders accused the United States of  
planning air strikes to plant fake chemical or germ warfare 
evidence at sites declared out of bounds to United Nations 
weapons inspectors. 
	 Asked if the United States was planning to bomb Iraqi sites  
with conventional weapons, without any chemical or biological 
component, the White House spokesman said he would have ``no 
comment on that.'' 
	 Iraq issued its warning against a ``wicked American  
conspiracy'' after a meeting of the Revolutionary Command 
Council and the Regional Command of the ruling Baath party 
chaired by President Saddam Hussein. 
	 The meeting discussed the crisis over Baghdad's refusal to  
allow inspection of ``presidential sites,'' which the United 
States says may be used to evade Gulf War ceasefire terms that 
bar Iraq from holding weapons of mass destruction. 
	 ``America is likely to launch military strikes on these  
sites and others, using mass destruction weapons which contain 
chemical and biological elements, so that it can say, after the 
strikes, that its allegations were right,'' an Iraqi official 
spokesman told the Iraqi news agency INA. 
	 Iraq has banned the United Nations Special Commission in  
charge of dismantling the country's weapons of mass destruction 
from investigating its presidential sites. Baghdad has said no 
weapons are hidden at those locations. 
	 The United States has repeatedly insisted that Iraq allow  
the investigators access to the sites and has pointedly refused 
to rule out the use of force if Iraq does not comply with the 
U.N. inspections regime.
