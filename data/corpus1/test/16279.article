across the Americas on Friday agreed to launch hemispheric 
free trade talks in 1998 but left gaping differences over the 
nature of those talks to be settled at a later date. 
	 Brazilian and U.S. officials, the key players in the third  
ministerial meeting of the 34 signatory countries working for 
a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) pact, said they were 
satisfied and that the dream of free trade had taken ``a big 
step forward.'' 
	 ``We are not at all disappointed. We are quite satisfied,''  
said Brazilian Foreign Minister Luiz Felipe Lampreia in the 
Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte. 
	 ``No one's position has been prejudiced,,'' added deputy  
U.S. Trade Representative Peter Allgeier at the same briefing. 
	 The FTAA project was adopted by every country in the  
Americas except Cuba at the Miami summit in 1994. It envisaged 
a free trade zone of nearly one billion consumers and gross 
domestic product in excess of $9.0 billion by 2005. 
	 The talks in Brazil, charged with setting a launch date  
for formal negotiations, became embroiled in a dispute over 
the speed of the process between the United States and South 
America's Mercosur customs union. 
	 All countries agreed to start the negotiations after a  
March 1998 presidential summit in Santiago, Chile. 
	 But while Washington wanted to discuss everything from  
tariff cuts to subsidies at the same time, Mercosur, grouping 
Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, sought to split the 
talks into stages, with tariffs left till last. 
	 On arriving in Belo Horizonte, U.S. Trade Representative  
Charlene Barshefsky blasted a draft declaration prepared by 
deputy ministers, according to Brazilian government sources. 
	 ``If we remain in this halfway zone, it would be better to  
pack our bags and go home,'' Barshefsky reportedly said. 
	 A senior U.S. official, without confirming the remarks,  
noted: ``It's always a good idea to give people a wake-up 
call.'' 
	 The differences between the United States and Mercosur,  
rather than being overcome, were left to another ministerial 
FTAA meeting in Costa Rica in February 1998. 
	 ``We agree that the FTAA negotiations should be initiated  
at Santiago, in March 1998, and we will recommend to our 
leaders that they do so at that time,'' the final declaration 
said. 
	 ``To this end, at the Fourth Ministerial Meeting in San  
Jose, Costa Rica, in February 1998, we will formulate how the 
negotiations will proceed, including such features as their 
objectives, approaches, structure and venue.'' 
	 Allgeier noted that the declaration also set up a  
Preparatory Committee of the 34 deputy ministers responsible 
for trade and said this was important. 
	 ``The establishment of a Prep Comm shows to people inside  
and outside that we really are moving into a period of 
negotiation,'' Allgeier said. 
	 Diplomats noted the United States' bargaining power in  
Belo Horizonte has been hamstrung by the Clinton 
administration's admission that it faced daunting odds in 
getting so-called ``fast track'' negotiating authority from 
Congress this year. 
	 But both Lampreia and U.S. officials dismissed the  
significance of the fast track delay. 
	 The senior U.S. trade official said the Belo Horizonte  
declaration might even help sway Congress. 
	 ``I think it really does show the determination through the  
hemisphere to expand trade and investment and to break down 
trade barriers,'' he said, asking not to be named. 
	 The official added, ``This is a big step forward. We are  
very much on track to establish free trade by 2005.''
