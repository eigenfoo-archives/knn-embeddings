Fujimori basked Wednesday in the violent but victorious end to 
the worst crisis of his career and the longest hostage siege in 
Latin American history. 
	 But amid the euphoria after the storming of the besieged  
Japanese ambassador's home and the freedom of 71 VIP hostages, 
Fujimori was careful to avoid appearing over-confident. 
	 ``It could be that it (terrorism) is not defeated. There are  
still some but Peru cannot give in to terrorists' blackmail and 
Peru should show the international community that terrorism has 
no impact,'' he told reporters in the early hours of Wednesday 
after a meal with top ministers and aides. 
	 The Marxist Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA)  
movement, whose band of hostage-takers was slaughtered in 
Tuesday's surprise military assault, vowed not to give up its 
revolutionary war. 
	 Its international spokesman, Isaac Velazco, issued a stream  
of militant statements, denying the MRTA was dead and saying the 
guerrillas would retaliate by attacking military and economic 
targets in Peru. 
	 ``There are enough of us to continue the revolutionary war  
of the people for the creation of a just society, and to win,'' 
he said at a rally by about 30 MRTA sympathizers outside the 
Peruvian consulate in Hamburg, Germany. 
	 The MRTA's Dec. 17 storming of the diplomatic compound was  
the most daring strike in 17 years of violence in Peru, which 
has cost more than 30,000 lives and $25 billion in 
infrastructure damage. The rebels' assault had mocked Fujimori's 
previous claims the group was defunct. 
	 But the deaths of the 14-strong band who carried out the  
attack, including its leader Nestor Cerpa Cartolini, foiled the 
MRTA's plan to achieve a mass release of jailed comrades and 
left the group with just 200-odd fighters hiding in the jungle. 
	 Peru's larger Shining Path movement, although overshadowed  
by the MRTA in recent months, remains a more potent threat now 
to Fujimori's efforts to pacify Peru. 
	 ``We are prepared to face whatever eventuality,'' said  
Fujimori, who chose the military option against the MRTA 
hostage-takers just days after new polls showed him at a record 
low popularity level. ``But the rule that decides our conduct is 
not to retreat against terrorism, not one little bit.'' 
	 The president, whose recent slide in the approval ratings to  
a record low looked certain to be reversed at a stroke, slept 
Wednesday morning. He was rumored to be flying to a summit of 
Andean nation presidents later in the day. 
	 Tuesday's successful operation by 140 commandos from all  
three armed services brought an outpouring of rejoicing in Peru. 
	 Citizens took to the streets to wave flags, cheer and honk  
car horns. Congressmen rose to cheer ``Long live Peru!'' during 
a roll-call in parliament, which included the names of five 
legislators among the freed hostages. 
	 One captive, who was a supreme court judge, two soldiers and  
all 14 guerrillas, including two women, died in the fierce 
battle that ended the four-month siege. 
	 Judge Carlos Giusti Acuna, who was wounded and then died  
after a heart attack, was to be given a formal wake at the 
Palace of Justice in downtown Lima. 
	 The charred diplomatic compound, where the rebels' bodies  
remained, was closed off for two days during which it will be 
swept for mines and booby-traps laid by the MRTA. 
	 Troops avoided those dangers as they swarmed into the  
compound over walls from private houses and burst into the 
building from tunnels in an eruption of gunfire and explosions. 
Some tossed smoke bombs and grenades, while others fired sniper 
shots through the smoke using laser-guided rifles. 
	 The attack was planned after months of spying with  
microphones and infra-red sensors that gave security forces a 
precise image of the inside of the residence. 
	 It was timed to coincide with an indoor soccer game by the  
rebels, most of whom were teen-agers trained in Peru's remote 
eastern jungle zone. 
	 A rebel said the four youngest Tupac Amaru members tried to  
surrender before being killed. ``They were in a room on their 
own. They gave up out of fear,'' the MRTA rebel, who asked to 
remain anonymous but identified himself using a codename, told 
Reuters. But troops had orders to kill. 
	 The MRTA member said he heard the four surrender while he  
was monitoring an open, short-wave radio communication which the 
rebels maintained with their comrades in Lima. 
	 Exhausted but happy, the mainly middle-aged, male captives  
were reunited with families and friends and began recounting 
their 126-day ordeal with its dramatic finale. 
	 Bolivia's ambassador to Peru, Jorge Gumucio, said 10 of the  
rebels were playing soccer in a large reception room when the 
troops stormed in. ``They had turned the room into an indoor 
football pitch (field) under which were the tunnels full of 
explosives,'' he told Bolivian television. 
	 ``The operation began with explosions under the floor where  
they were playing and immediately afterwards in other tunnels 
through which the special troops entered.'' 
	 He revealed that some of the Peruvian military officers who  
were captives knew about the rescue plan beforehand. ``They 
warned us 10 minutes beforehand so we could not really prepare. 
We waited for them to come in and it was surgical, though with 
some cost especially for the special forces.'' 
	 Fujimori said extreme circumstances had prompted him to use  
force and confirmed that ``certain signals'' were given to 
hostages beforehand. He did not elaborate. 
	 The president rode through the streets of Lima Tuesday in a  
triumphant mood, waving a flag and shouting to crowds. One-by- 
one he shook hands with the soldiers who carried out the raid. 
	 But he fought back tears as he announced the death of Giusti  
and two commandos. One of them had been his son Kenji's 
bodyguard. ``There was no other way out,'' said Fujimori, who 
termed the operation was ``a relative success'' instead of a 
complete victory because of the deaths. 
	 The Peruvian leader had staked his political career on the  
decision to send in the troops after four months of fruitless 
negotiations with the MRTA. 
	 The soldiers, who had been preparing for months and received  
training from U.S. and British security experts, began bringing 
out hostages within minutes. 
	 The rebels originally took 500 hostages but released most in  
the early days of the crisis, keeping those they considered most 
valuable to obtain the release of jailed comrades.
