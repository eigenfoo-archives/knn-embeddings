Sunday condemned the murder of a Spanish politician by Basque 
separatist group ETA as an unjustifiable act of barbarity. 
	 ``I have followed with pain the news from Spain about the  
barbarous assassination of young Spanish politician Miguel Angel 
Blanco,'' he told followers from the the mountain resort of Les 
Combes in the Italian Alps, where he is on holiday. 
	 ``I forcefully deplore this act of blood. The killing of an  
innocent victim can never be justified.'' 
	 Blanco, 29, a low-ranking member of the ruling Popular  
Party, died on Sunday from two gunshot wounds to the head. 
	 ETA, which has killed nearly 800 people in a 29-year war for  
a separate state, kidnapped Blanco on Thursday and threatened to 
kill him by 4 p.m. on Saturday unless some 500 ETA inmates in 
jails across Spain were transferred to the Basque region. 
	 Government officials had refused to give in to blackmail.  
	 Blanco's death was greeted with outrage in Italy and given  
lengthy media coverage. ``ETA hits at the heart of Spain,'' La 
Repubblica newspaper said in a headline. 
	 ``In Spain the nightmare of Basque terrorism is back but  
this time the whole country is united against it,'' said La 
Stampa. 
	 Prime Minister Romano Prodi sent condolences to his Spanish  
counterpart Jose Maria Aznar. ``I would like to express Italy's 
sense of profound indignation for the barbarous act carried out 
by terrorists against town councillor Miguel Angel Blanco 
Garrido,'' he said. 
	 President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro said the attack ``offends the  
conscience of the whole civil world.'' 
	 ``The values of...democracy will never be beaten by those  
who are ready to spill the blood of innocent victims in contempt 
for the laws of human solidarity..,'' he said. 
	 Hundreds of thousands of people took part in demonstrations  
across Spain on Saturday to demand Blanco's release and express 
their anger at a wave of ETA violence in recent months. Blanco 
is the Basque guerrilla group's 10th victim this year. 
	 Clashes broke out in the city of Pamplona on Sunday.  
Witnesses said hundreds of youths shouting ``Sons of Bitches'' 
and ``Murderers'' attacked a group of ETA supporters and tried 
to burn the offices of the group's political wing, Herri 
Batasuna. 
	 The Pope said he prayed for Blanco's family. ``I appeal to  
the Lord to grant the dear Spanish people courage and tenacity 
on the road to living together in peace and serenity,'' he added.
