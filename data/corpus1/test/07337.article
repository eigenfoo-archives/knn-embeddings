the tapes in two flight recorders recovered from the wreckage of 
TWA flight 800 off New York were not damaged and they hoped to 
have preliminary information from them later in the day. 
	 ``We hope to have information off both recorders today,''  
the National Transportation Safety Board's Director of Research 
and Engineering, Bernard Loeb, told a news conference at which 
he displayed the two orange boxes. ``The tapes were in good 
condition,'' he said. ``They are in the lab right now.'' 
	 Later, CNN reported investigators had learned nothing new in  
a first examination of the recorders' data. 
	 NTSB officials said one of the boxes, the cockpit voice  
recorder, was expected to yield the final conversations of the 
cabin crew as well as cabin noises that might give them clues 
about the cause of the explosion shortly after the airliner took 
off from New York's John F. Kennedy airport en route for Paris 
last Wednesday. 
	 The second recorder will provide technical information on  
the flight, including its direction, altitude and speed at the 
time of the incident. 
	 But Loeb said the information may not pinpoint the precise  
reason for the accident. ``I can't even say if the recorders 
will yield that information,'' he said in reply to a question on 
whether they would prove a bomb was on board. 
	 He said the bright orange boxes, which looked badly dented,  
were in a fairly typical state for recorders recovered from 
crash sites although a pinger meant to send signals to aid in 
recovery was missing from the voice recorder. 
	 But Loeb said the pinger on the flight data recorder was  
operating and he was not sure why sonar instruments used by 
search teams did not pick it up. He speculated that perhaps it 
had been buried in the sand or there was some signal 
interference with the sonars being used. 
	 NTSB officials said that the tapes, similar to conventional  
tapes used in ordinary voice recorders, were being processed at 
the agency's laboratory using cheesecloth to clean and dry them 
before analysts listened to them. 
	 Loeb said that NTSB vice chairman Robert Francis, who is  
supervising the investigation at the scene on Long Island, will 
make any further announcements about the results of the review 
of the tapes.
