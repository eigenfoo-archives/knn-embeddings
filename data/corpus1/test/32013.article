Catholics who failed to do enough to help Jews against Nazi 
persecution but defended wartime Pope Pius XII from accusations 
he turned a blind eye to the Holocaust. 
	 Jews expressed dissatisfaction with the landmark document  
entitled ``We Remember, a Reflection on the Shoah.'' Some said 
it was too little, too late. 
	 The document decried the ``unspeakable tragedy...of the  
killing of millions of Jews'' and said Christians had a moral 
duty to ensure it never happened again. 
	 The document clearly defended Pope Pius from accusations by  
some Jews he did not do everything in his power to help them. 
	 ``During and after the war, Jewish communities and Jewish  
leaders expressed their thanks for all that had been done for 
them, including what Pope Pius XII did personally or through his 
representatives to save hundreds of thousands of Jewish lives,'' 
it said. 
	 Vatican historians say Pius did not speak out more  
forcefully for fear of worsening the situation for Catholics, as 
well as Jews, in Germany and Nazi-occupied countries. 
	 While Jews welcomed the document's strong condemnation of  
anti-Semitism, they said it failed to account adequately for the 
role of Catholic teachings in spawning it and criticized its 
defense of Pius XII. 
	 ``The blurriness of part of the Church on the eve of and  
during the Holocaust, and mainly its plastering over of the part 
of who then headed the Church, Pius XII, is not yet acceptable 
to us,'' said Israel's Chief Rabbi Yisrael Lau. 
	 ``I don't think that we can't talk about rectifying the past  
without pointing at who...didn't do anything to save what it was 
possible to save,'' he told reporters. 
	 Cardinal Edward Cassidy, the Australian head of the Vatican  
Commission for Religious Relations with Jews, told a news 
conference he did not know whether the case of Pius XII would be 
taken up again in the future. 
	 But he said the Church was satisfied that its own historians  
had studied the period thoroughly and ``their conclusion would 
be very strongly that Pius XII does not have a case to answer.'' 
	 He said the document was ``more than an apology'' to the  
Jews. 
	 ``This is an act of repentance. This is more than an apology  
since as members of the Church we are linked to the sins as well 
as to the merits of all her children,'' he said. 
	 ``We feel that we have to repent. Not only for what we may  
have done individually but also for those members of our Church 
who failed in this regard,'' he added. 
	 Rabbi James Rudin, inter-religious affairs director of the  
New York-based American Jewish Committee, said: ``I would say it 
represents the three ``Rs'' -- remembrance, repentance and 
resolve...and it's a very strong denunciation of 
anti-Semitism.'' 
	 In Jerusalem, Efraim Zuroff, director of the Israel office  
of the Simon Wiesenthal Center that researches Nazi crimes, said 
the statemment was ``far less'' than what he had hoped for. 
	 ``I think that while acknowledging the enormity of the  
tragedy is important, there is a need for an unequivocal 
acknowledging of the role played by the Church's teaching in 
anti-Semitism that paved the way for the crimes of the 
Holocaust,'' he told Reuters. 
	 Rudin called for ``a full exploration by Catholic and Jewish  
scholars of the wartime period.'' 
	 In Jerusalem, Yitzhak Minerbi, a scholar on relations with  
the Vatican said: ``I found it to be first of all an attempt to 
safeguard the memory of Pope Pius XII, who throughout World War 
Two never condemned the Nazi persecution of Jews.'' 
	 The document also defended some members of the German Church  
hierarchy during the war, saying they had criticized Nazism. 
	 The document said that while many Christians helped the Jews  
when they were persecuted, ``others did not.'' Many people 
during the war were ``altogether unaware of the 'final solution' 
that was being put into effect against a whole people.'' 
	 In the document's brief introduction, Pope John Paul said  
the Holocaust would forever remain an ``indelible stain'' on the 
20th century and urged Christians to ``examine themselves for 
the responsibility which they too have for the evils of our 
time.'' 
	 The pope, who has made improving relations with Jews a major  
aim of his 20-year-old papacy, said he hoped the document would 
``help to heal the wounds of past misunderstandings and 
injustices.'' 
	 He added: ``May it enable memory to play its necessary part  
in the process of shaping a future in which the unspeakable 
iniquity of the Shoah will never again be possible.'' 
	 The document made a distinction between anti-Judaism  
practiced by some Christians through the ages and 20th-century 
anti-Semitism, particularly as practiced under the Nazis. 
	 ``The Shoah was the work of a thoroughly modern neo-pagan  
regime. Its anti-Semitism had it roots outside of Christianity 
and, in pursuing its aims, it did not hesitate to oppose the 
Church and persecute her members also,'' it said.
