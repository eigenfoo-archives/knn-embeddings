into open warfare Wednesday with leader-founder Jean-Marie Le Pen 
sacking his rival, party Number Two Bruno Megret, for joining a 
rebel challenge to his authority. 
   Megret's abrupt removal came barely two hours after he joined  
party rebels in calling for a special conference of the party in 
January that could have sought majority support to unseat the 
70-year-old founder of the group. 
   Wasting little time in trying to stamp out threats to his  
26-year leadership of the pariah party, Le Pen announced Megret had 
been stripped of his post and replaced by loyalist Carl Lang. 
   "To call today for a special conference, in the full swing of  
(1999) European elections is a crime against the Front and a crime 
against France," Le Pen said on television, accusing his rival of 
being party to a plot for his ouster. 
   Speaking earlier at a news conference, Megret said more than  
half the party's local branches and elected officials had so far 
come out in favour of holding such a conference, despite Le Pen's 
opposition. 
   "I call on all members to cease sterile quarrels and come  
together to rebuild party unity and victory," Megret said. 
   But Le Pen retorted that the Front had "better things to do"  
than hold party conference, referring to European elections next 
June. "There's no reason to hold a conference given it'll be a 
conference of confrontation and not of unity," he said. 
   The idea of a democratic conference in a party ruled by Le Pen's  
iron fist surfaced Monday after a simmering leadership quarrel 
between the two men blew up in public last weekend. 
   The call for a grass-roots democratic vote on the leadership  
challenge was launched by Serge Martinez, who heads regional 
branches. He was immediately sacked by Le Pen, along with other 
proponents of the scheme. 
   Describing the idea as an "intelligent initiative", while saying  
he had nothing to do with it, Megret urged Front members to attend 
"a big congress of unity and renewal" in January 1999. 
   With mainstream parties glued to the drama unfolding in the  
hopes of a possible demise of the pariah party, Megret insisted he 
was "resolutely opposed to any notion of a split" and said 
"exclusions, suspensions and sackings ahead of the conference have 
no meaning or value. 
   "Our future lies within the National Front," said the  
49-year-old Megret, who represents a generation and class of 
far-right French politician different from the charismatic Le Pen. 
   Le Pen, who likes to state "I am the party", earlier Wednesday  
lost a key ally -- his own daughter Marie-Caroline -- in his 
struggle to ward off the leadership challenge. 
   "The militants want to be heard," said far-right Euro-MP Le  
Gallou, who sits on the same regional council in the greater Paris 
area as Marie-Caroline Le Pen. "They feel the president has been cut 
off from the grass-roots by his entourage." 
   The National Front has been gaining ground in France since the  
early 1980s, drawing votes on a platform to send foreigners home and 
give preference to French nationals, as unemployment grows and 
nationalist concerns blossom amid the bolstering of the European 
Union and the global economy. 
   Fighting tooth and nail to hold on to the reins of France's  
third biggest party, one that regularly brings in 15 percent of the 
vote, Le Pen ironically accused his challengers of "racism" and 
"extremism". 
   Le Pen's history of verbal and physical assaults, which have won  
him a series of court convictions notably for inciting racial 
hatred, is one of the reasons behind the Megret camp's growing 
frustration with his leadership. 
   But the quarrel, too, underlines the existing rift between the  
party's two wings -- Le Pen's rebuttal of the mainstream 
conservative right compared with Megret's wish to strike alliances 
with his opponents to break the National Front's isolation.
