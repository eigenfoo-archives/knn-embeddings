President Mobutu Sese Seko had 24 hours to resign or go into 
exile before they renewed their military campaign. 
	 Rebels were just 187 miles away from the capital Kinshasa,  
said radio Voice of the People broadcast from the eastern town 
of Goma, rebel headquarters. 
	 ``Mr. Mobutu has just 24 hours thanks to the extreme  
generosity of the Alliance. He has only two choices -- to resign 
or to go into exile,'' the radio said. 
	 The radio quoted South African deputy president Thabo Mbeki  
as saying that Mobutu was welcome as an exile in South Africa. 
	 Rebel leader Laurent Kabila declared from Thursday a  
three-day ``pause'' in the advance of the Alliance of Democratic 
Forces for the Liberation of Congo/Zaire (AFDL) after the 
capture of second city Lubumbashi, capital of Shaba region. 
	 The slowdown was aimed at stepping-up pressure on Mobutu,  
Zaire's ruler since 1965 but now ailing with cancer. 
	 Kabila, Alliance ministers and military commanders spent  
Friday closeted in a meeting at Mobutu's former palace in Goma 
planning strategy in the light of the fall of Lubumbashi. 
	 Alliance rebels now control Gecamines copper mines in Shaba  
and a series of mineral fields whose potential runs into 
billions of dollars. 
	 ``We want serious investors who don't pillage, who keep the  
law, give work to the people. It is not just a question of take 
the (minerals) and run,'' Kabila recently told reporters. 
	 Western mining companies are queuing up to renegotiate  
existing contracts with the rebels, or to explore the potential 
for opening new sites in rebel-held territory, according to 
mining officials. 
	 Mining interest is tempered by a high political risk factor  
in territory controlled by the AFDL, a group unheard of only six 
months ago. 
	 ``The Alliance must balance getting money into their  
treasury and leaving it a while so that political stability has 
an impact on the discount value,'' a mining official said. 
	 Alliance rebels control around half of the vast country and  
are pushing into Equateur province and Western Kasai region. 
	 Aid workers, priests and Goma residents accuse the Alliance  
of the mass murder of civilians in its own backyard in a dirty 
ethnic war in the Masisi west of Goma. 
	 Ethnic Tutsis at the core of the Alliance fighting force are  
cleansing the Masisi of Hutus in a war against the former 
Rwandan government army and extremist Interahamwe militiamen. 
	 Rwandan and Alliance governments share a common interest in  
removing the threat posed by the armed Hutus who first fled 
Rwanda after the 1994 genocide of an estimated 800,000 Tutsis 
and Hutu moderates. 
	 ``The problem for the Tutsis is that they need land for  
their cattle, but the Hutus are in the majority so they need to 
exterminate Hutus to balance the population,'' a long-time 
non-native resident of the Masisi told Reuters 
	 Kabila rejects accusations that civilians are killed in the  
Masisi, arguing they have a right to secure territory liberated 
without help from the international community. 
	 ``It is stupid rubbish about the Alliance killing people (in  
the Masisi)...These former Rwandan government forces who were 
defending Kisangani are coming through the forest at Walikale to 
Rwanda through the Masisi and they don't go without killing 
people so we must stop them,'' Kabila told reporters this week.
