bade farewell Tuesday as leader of the ruling African National 
Congress (ANC) with a stinging attack on whites, the media, former 
apartheid leaders and his political opponents. 
   Mandela's aides said his "robust" speech was a warning to South  
Africans that tensions were rising due to resistance by large 
numbers of whites to the process of transformation from apartheid to 
a non-racial democracy. 
   In a 53-page speech opening the ANC's 50th national conference,  
Mandela said there was no direct threat to the country's democracy, 
but warned that "elements" of the former white-minority regime were 
trying to destabilise the country. 
   The 79-year-old statesman will formally step down from the  
position he has held since 1991 when the party holds new elections 
for senior officials on Wednesday, although he will continue as head 
of state until 1999. 
   Mandela told 3,000 delegates gathered at a university in this  
north-western farming town that it has been "demonstrated 
consistently" that whites are trying to cling to the privileges they 
enjoyed under apartheid. 
   The mainly white political parties, Mandela said, have been  
"most vigorous in their opposition" to legislative and executive 
measures to end racial disparity. 
   His speech, his last delivered as ANC leader, was greeted by  
rapturous applause, dancing and singing. Several ANC leaders 
embraced and kissed Mandela, including his ex-wife and a strong 
critic of the leadership, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. 
   But it drew scathing criticism from the National Party, which  
decried it as paranoid, irresponsible and un-statesmanlike. 
   One political analyst described it as "very defensive," adding  
that it smacked of "an underlying intolerance of criticism." 
   Mandela attacked the mainly white-owned media as representing  
the "privileged minority" which had done its best to discredit the 
achievements of the ANC. 
   Environment Affairs Minister Pallo Jordan told journalists  
Mandela had wanted to warn the country that as the process of 
transformation deepens, tensions will heighten. 
   "The president wanted to make it clear that as we move forward,  
no one should attribute these tensions to the new leadership of the 
ANC," he said. 
   Transport Minister Mac Maharaj acknowledged the speech might  
leave whites feeling uncomfortable but said too many whites felt 
that that since democracy had been achieved, they had no role in the 
transformation process. Others deliberately resisted it. 
   In his speech, Mandela said that "various elements" of the  
former apartheid government have formed a "counter-revolutionary 
network ... which would launch or intensify a campaign of 
destabilisation." 
   The apartheid elements, he added, were bidding to weaken the ANC  
and its allies, use crime to render the country ungovernable, 
subvert the economy, and erode confidence in the ANC to govern. 
   The South African leader decried low morals in South African  
society -- including corruption, white collar crime, low tax 
morality, acceptance of robbery and theft as a means of personal 
gain, and contempt for the law and the state. 
   "If we have learnt nothing else during these three years," he  
said, "we have grown to appreciate the extent of the corrosion of 
the moral fibre of our society." 
   He also slammed "careerists" within party ranks, who used the  
ANC to advance their personal ambitions. 
   However the outgoing ANC president expressed full confidence in  
those about to take over the reins -- especially South African 
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki who is the unopposed candidate for ANC 
president. 
   "It is at this point that my generation, which did what it  
could, hands over the baton to our successors," Mandela said. 
   Political analyst Sheila Meintjes, a lecturer at Johannesburg's  
Witwatersrand University, described the speech as "very defensive" 
and said it showed a lack of understanding of the democratic need 
for "an independent and critical civil society." 
   Meintjes said Mandela should have used the occasion to map the  
achievements of his government rather than resorting to a series of 
attacks on his opponents. 
   "There is (in the speech) an underlying intolerance of criticism  
and opposition," Meintjes said. 
   A National Party (NP) deputy, Renier Schoeman, said: "Instead of  
unifying South Africa, Mr Mandela's speech can have the effect of 
creating tension between black South Africans on the one hand, and 
white, coloured and Indian South Africans on the other."
