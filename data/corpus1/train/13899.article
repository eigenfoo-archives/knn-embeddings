tighter security measures on Monday, one day after a distraught 
Palestinian man shot to death one tourist and wounded six others 
before taking his own life on the world-famous skyscraper's 
observation deck. 
	 Building management maintained that security was adequate  
before Sunday afternoon's apparently random attack but said it 
was taking the additional steps of installing baggage scanners 
and would use a variety of metal detectors so that all visitors 
to the observatory could be checked. 
	 The observation deck was closed on Monday but would be  
reopened to visitors on Tuesday morning, officials said. 
	 ``The Empire State Building has excellent security 24 hours  
a day, seven days a week,'' general manager Steven Tole told a 
news conference on the 86th-floor, where 69-year-old Ali Abu 
Kamal opened fire with a semiautomatic handgun. 
	 A security camera showed Kamal on his way up to the  
observation deck wearing a long coat that hid the weapon, a 
spokesman for the building said. Metal detectors were used at 
the landmark building on Fifth Avenue for a few months after the 
1993 World Trade Center bombing but later were removed. 
	 ``The Empire State Building has been host to more than 95  
million visitors without one serious incident,'' Tole said. He 
said the problem was ``guns getting into the city, this is guns 
coming from Florida, this could have happened anywhere.'' 
	 Authorities said the gunman arrived in the United States on  
a flight from Egypt in December, set up residence at a motel in 
Florida and legally bought a .308-caliber Beretta, which he used 
in his shooting spree as 125 people were enjoying the 
spectacular views on a sunny afternoon. 
	 ``We have no reason to believe that this was someone other  
than a deranged individual acting on his own,'' New York City 
Police Commissioner Howard Safir told a news conference. 
	 The widow of the gunman said on Monday in Gaza that her  
husband was not politically motivated but in despair over having 
been cheated out of $500,000. She said he traveled to the United 
States last December seeking a financier for a new investment 
company. 
	 ``My husband is not a terrorist, he was just hopeless,''  
Fathiya Abu Kamal, 55, said. ``He was aged, he had nothing to do 
with politics, or terrorism, or crime.'' 
	 The gunman shot dead Christoffer Burmeister, a 27-year-old  
Dane who was jazz guitarist for the Bush Pilots rock band, and 
wounded six other people -- Matthew Gross, 29, of Connecticut, 
who played in the same band, a 52-year-old Argentine man, a 
30-year-old Swiss man, a 35-year old Bronx, New York man and a 
married couple from Verdun, France. 
	 Police said Kamal died without regaining consciousness in a  
New York hospital about six hours after the shootings, which 
occurred just after 5 p.m. Three of the wounded were in critical 
condition on Monday and three others were serious but stable, 
hospital officials said. 
	 Law enforcement officials said the gunman was carrying  
documents from the Palestinian Authority that showed he lived in 
Ramallah on the West Bank and was born in Jaffa. 
	 At a City Hall news conference, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and  
gun control advocates bitterly decried the ease with which a 
foreign visitor to the United States could purchase a powerful 
gun. Kamal bought the gun legally under Florida and federal laws 
but would have had to meet stricter identification and 
residential requirements in New York, Giuliani said. 
	 New York Democratic Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, who became a gun  
control lobbyist after her husband was shot to death and her son 
wounded on a commuter train in 1993, told reporters national gun 
laws had to be changed. ``The time has come. It's an 
embarassment to this country,'' she said. ``We're letting 
innocent people die every single day.'' 
	 Several other people were injured in the pandemonium that  
broke out after the shooting, the worst bloodshed at the 
102-story building since July 1945, when a B-25 bomber lost in 
fog crashed into the 79th floor, killing 14 people and injuring 
26 others. 
	 The Empire State Building, which opened in 1931, is one of  
New York City's top tourist attractions, and at 1,250 feet high 
it ranked for decades as the world's tallest building.
