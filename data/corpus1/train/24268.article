French truckers' strike Wednesday as the country's main trucking 
firms and unions returned to the negotiating table. 
	On the third day of the nationwide blockade, Transportation  
Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot held out hope that the talks, the 
first with all sides since Friday, could lead to an agreement in 
a stoppage that has paralyzed France and angered its trade 
partners in Europe. 
	 The talks broke for lunch after the unions presented new  
wage demands. Union officials said the employers were expected 
to respond when the session resume at in the afternoon. 
	 Meanwhile, a dozen masked men charged a roadblock near  
Marseille, beating three truckers with iron bars to open the 
route for about 12 refrigerator trucks. 
	 One striker was rushed to hospital with serious head  
injuries from the attack at Vitrolles. 
	 ``Around 4 o'clock, a dozen refrigerator trucks drove the  
wrong way along an exit ramp to the A55 highway,'' said 
Jean-Yves Petit of the CFDT union. 
	 ``A dozen masked men accompanied the convoy and they  
attacked the cars and the people here.'' 
	 Traffic officials counted 160 roadblocks by late morning,  
with Normandy, the Marseille area and the Rhone Valley worst 
hit. Petrol shortages and hoarding of foodstuffs were reported 
from around the country. 
	 Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said the strike had  
not yet had an important economic effect. 
	 Delegates from the UFT, the employers' association whose  
walkout last Friday crippled last-ditch wage talks, said they 
wanted an agreement and thought negotiations at the 
Transportation Ministry could go on late into the night. 
	 ``We want to negotiate and reach a durable solution. We are  
optimistic,'' Jean-Paul Deneuville of the FNTR, the main 
employers group in the UFT employers association, said as he 
entered the transport ministry for the talks. 
	 The Union of Transport Federations represents 80 percent of  
road hauling firms. 
	 Gayssot, a communist who has visited a roadblock to show  
solidarity with the strikers, was pleased with the resumption of 
the talks. 
	 ``There's hope insofar as everybody is back at the table,''  
he told journalists. ``I think the sense of responsibility and 
commitment will carry the day.'' 
	 Gayssot stressed that any commitments made at the talks  
would have to be respected. 
	 One reason for this strike was the fact that only 5 percent  
of the haulage firms have paid out a bonus agreed after a 12-day 
strike last year. 
	 Among other demands, the unions want an hourly wage for  
drivers, who say they often put in long days on the road without 
getting fully paid for them. The employers prefer a yearly or 
monthly salary. 
	 An estimated 350,000 truckers have set up roadblocks around  
the country to halt all truck traffic. Private cars are usually 
let through but foreign trucks are held up. 
	 Spanish farmers, faced with estimated losses of $170 million  
a week, threatened to retaliate Tuesday with a nationwide 
boycott of French goods. 
	 Eduardo Mendez, a spokesman for Spain's association of  
international road transporters ATIC, estimated about 300 
Spanish trucks were stranded in France. 
	 Spanish government officials have said some 8,000 Spanish  
trucks have been affected -- delayed, trapped by roadblocks, or 
forced to take alternative routes.
