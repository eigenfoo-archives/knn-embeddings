up a banned opposition march in Kinshasa Wednesday, beating and 
arresting protesters on the eve of Laurent Kabila's inauguration 
as president of the Democratic Republic of Congo. 
	 Several thousand supporters of veteran opposition leader  
Etienne Tshisekedi took part in the march, denouncing the 
presence of Rwandans among Kabila's forces who marched into 
Kinshasa on May 17 to oust veteran dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. 
	 Soldiers from Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces for the  
Liberation of Congo allowed the march to go ahead after initial 
hesitation but dispersed the protesters later, firing in the air 
and beating them with batons and rifle butts. 
	 ``We will continue until there is an army in the service of  
the people,'' Tshisekedi ally Joseph Oleghankoy told Reuters, 
but he expressed the hope that Tshisekedi and Kabila would meet 
to settle their differences. 
	 ``Look at this! It's dictatorship but it's even worse now  
because the oppressors are foreigners,'' marcher Martin Dibenda 
told Reuters after the troops broke up the protest. 
	 Oleghankoy said at least 30 protesters were arrested and  
taken away to military camps. 
	 Tens of thousands of residents lined the streets, cheering  
the marchers and making V-for-Victory signs. 
	 ``Kabila should have a chance but we do not want the  
Rwandans,'' one female student told Reuters. ``We just do not 
want the Rwandans. They have got to go.'' 
	 She was among hundreds of students blocked by soldiers in  
the central Higher of Institute of Commerce, once a hotbed of 
opposition to ousted dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, but many 
marchers echoed her sentiments. 
	 There was little sign of soldiers along much of the march  
route until they intervened to break up the protest. 
	 ``We are here to bring order, that is all,'' one commander  
told Reuters at the commerce institute. 
	 The protesters marched from the capital's central railway  
station to Victory Square, where Mobutu soldiers shot dead at 
least 16 opposition protesters during a peaceful rally in 1992. 
	 Soldiers, mainly ethnic Tutsis, broke up the marchers as  
they headed for Tshisekedi's home district of Limete. 
	 They briefly detained journalists, confiscating their film.  
	 Kabila himself left the city Tuesday for the southern mining  
capital of Lubumbashi. Officials declined to say why but added 
they expected him back later Wednesday. 
	 Tshisekedi, a veteran Mobutu opponent, enjoys much support  
in the capital's poor districts. His Union for Democracy and 
Social Progress (UDPS) has called another march Friday. 
	 ``We are marching to protest about the Rwandans,'' said  
Jean- Claude Mukendi, an unemployed youth and supporter of 
Tshisekedi, a veteran Mobutu opponent. ``Mr Tshisekedi knows the 
Zairian people do not want to be ruled by foreigners.'' 
	 Opposition activists marched in Kinshasa Friday and  
Saturday. Kabila forces fired in the air and took away some 
protesters. Government officials said they were later released. 
	 Kabila's Alliance, which fought seven months of civil war,  
later banned political activity and public demonstrations. 
	 Tshisekedi, citing a 1992 vote in a sovereign national  
conference in what was then Zaire, has doggedly insisted over 
the years that constitutionally he is prime minister. His 
supporters say he should be allowed to take office as such. 
	 Meanwhile in Cape Town, South African President Nelson  
Mandela told visiting U.S. congressmen they need not fear a 
dictatorship in the former Zaire. 
	 ``.. We understand and appreciate the concern about  
democracy in that country,'' he said. ``Because of my 
association with President Kabila, I have no such fear at all 
because of the steps that he has taken already.'' 
	 Mandela's government was among the first to recognize Kabila  
after he declared himself president. 
	 Mandela told a bi-partisan U.S. delegation led by  
Congressman Ed Royce of California that Kabila had asked the 
people of Kisangani in eastern Zaire to elect local 
representatives a few days after his forces captured the 
third-largest town on March 15. 
	 The South African leader has taken pains in recent days to  
play down Western concerns about Kabila's democratic credentials 
and his refusal to schedule immediate elections. 
	 Kabila has set up a 13-member government. Aides say he plans  
to name seven more ministers but not a prime minister. 
	 Tshisekedi aides say that apart from the soldiers, at least  
two of his ministers are Rwandan. 
	 On a lighter note, Kabila's government changed the name of  
the national soccer squad from the Leopards, a name with strong 
Mobutu associations, to the Simbas -- Swahili for the Lions.
