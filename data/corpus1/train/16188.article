for the June 2 federal election was cut short suddenly Tuesday 
when the moderator collapsed, leaving the five political party 
leaders stunned. 
	 Moderator Claire Lamarche, a television personality in  
French-speaking Quebec, fell out of her chair moaning about the 
heat in the room just as the five political party leaders were 
about to attack the key election issue of national unity. 
	 ``We decided together that the debate should not continue  
under the circumstances,'' Arnold Amber, one of organizers of 
the debate, said in a hastily arranged news conference. ``All 
the parties are in agreement with this.'' 
	 The party leaders left without speaking to the media.  
	 Canadians had expected a lively debate on how to handle the  
troubling issue of Quebec independence. But the moderator's 
collapse made the abbreviated exchange anti-climactic, said 
political scientist Ken McRoberts at York University in Toronto. 
	 ``There might have been some dramatic moments in the  
exchange over the response to a (pro-sovereignty vote),'' 
McRoberts said in a phone interview from Toronto. ``So 
(separatist Bloc Quebecois leader Gilles) Duceppe must be quite 
frustrated.'' 
	 Duceppe, a francophone, was sidelined in the English debate  
 Monday night but observers expected him to use the  
French-language debate to rally the separatist forces and gather 
support for his waning campaign. 
	 The debate was about two hours into its scheduled 2 1/2 hours  
when the moderator collapsed, just as Prime Minister Jean 
Chretien was asked if he would recognize a vote in favor of 
Quebec sovereignty if it were by a slim margin. 
	 In 1995, people in French-speaking Quebec voted 50.6 percent  
against Quebec separation, while 49.4 percent voted in favor of 
separation, prompting federalist forces to claim victory. 
	 But instead of exploring how the next government would  
handle an expected referendum on sovereignty next year, the 
debate focused on Canada's high unemployment rate, robbing 
Duceppe of the chance to stir up much nationalist spirit. 
	 ``You decreased the deficit on the backs of the poor,''  
Duceppe accused the prime minister. 
	 But Chretien, much feistier in the French debate than in  
Monday night's English debate, fended off his competitors time 
and again, speaking about his party's economic record. 
	 Unemployment, especially among young Canadians ``is a very  
serious problem,'' Chretien said. ``However, first you have to 
have an economy which creates jobs, and this is the reason why 
we have to get rid of the deficit.'' 
	 Under Chretien's Liberals, the budget deficit has been cut  
back from about C$42 billion (US$30.3 billion) in 1993 to a 
projected 1996 defecit of C$16 billion (US$11.5 billion). But 
Canada's unemployment rate has hovered stubbornly between nine 
and 10 percent for much of Liberals' term. 
	 Chretien, Duceppe and Progressive Conservative leader Jean  
Charest -- the three francophone leaders -- spent much of the 
evening trying to show their parties had Quebec's best interests 
at heart. 
	 The two anglophone leaders -- Preston Manning, the leader of  
the right-wing Reform Party, and Alexa McDonough, who heads the 
left-leaning New Democratic Party -- were marginalized by their 
poor French. 
	 Over the two days of debates, Charest appears to have fared  
better than the other leaders. ``My sense is that Charest shone, 
as he did (Monday) night,'' McRoberts said. ``He is very 
articulate and very well prepared.'' 
	 Charest's leadership has already translated into a surge in  
his popularity in Quebec. A recent poll indicated he was the 
most popular of federal party leaders in Quebec. 
	 The Progressive Conservatives have a long way to go,  
however. They currently hold only two of 295 seats in the House 
of Commons after being decimated in the last federal election. 
	 The Liberals have a huge lead in opinion polls, with the  
backing of between 42 and 47 percent of decided voters.
