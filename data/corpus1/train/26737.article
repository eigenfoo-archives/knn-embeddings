Albright failed Thursday to bridge gaps between Israeli and 
Palestinian leaders and proposed that President Bill Clinton 
should meet them next month to try to get peace talks back on 
track. 
	 Albright said she held ``substantive and intensive'' talks  
with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Paris and 
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat in London, but ``these are 
complicated issues and gaps remain.'' 
	 ``With that in mind, I am going to recommend to the  
president that he meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu and 
Chairman Arafat separately in Washington in January,'' she told 
a news conference. 
	 Albright, attempting to break a nine-month deadlock in peace  
talks, had been trying to get Israel to offer a firm troop 
pullback in the West Bank and the Palestinians to take action to 
stop guerrilla attacks. 
	 Arafat said in London that in a later phase he might meet  
Netanyahu ``in the presence of a third party'' to try to breathe 
life into the peace process. 
	 He made the cryptic remark -- a possible hint at direct U.S.  
mediation by Clinton or Albright -- after he met British Foreign 
Secretary Robin Cook. He then saw Prime Minister Tony Blair, who 
takes over the European Union presidency next month. 
	 Arafat told reporters: ``The European role is extremely  
important. Do not forget that Europe is one of the signatories 
of the Oslo agreement.'' 
	 He confirmed that Palestinian and U.S. officials had agreed  
on the text of a document on security cooperation but said 
Israel had yet to agree the draft. 
	 But Netanyahu, in Luxembourg after his meeting in Paris with  
Albright, shot down the Palestinian announcement and newspaper 
reports that the sides had signed a deal. 
	 ``We have a general set of principles. We have not worked  
out a detailed plan. That...has to be worked out,'' he told a 
joint news conference with Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude 
Juncker. 
	 Israel's Maariv newspaper said the deal included a  
Palestinian pledge to fight ``terror,'' arrest militants of the 
Hamas and Islamic Jihad groups which were behind suicide 
bombings in Israel and collect illegal weapons in 
Palestinian-ruled areas. 
	 Albright's inconclusive talks on Israeli withdrawals in the  
West Bank followed deadlock within Netanyahu's coalition over 
the issue. 
	 A turbulent series of Israeli cabinet meetings over the past  
few days failed to come up with any percentage figure for a 
troop pullback. 
	 ``Ultimately, the decisions on whether progress will be  
possible are not American decisions,'' Albright said. ``Only the 
parties can make these decisions and, with our help, we are 
hopeful they will make them.'' 
	 U.S. officials said both Netanyahu and Arafat were being  
asked to make painful decisions that could alienate their 
supporters and it was appropriate that a political leader like 
Clinton should become involved. 
	 They said they hoped that by the time of the meetings with  
Clinton, for which no exact date had been set, the Israeli and 
Palestinian leaders would have taken the decisions Washington 
sought. 
	 ``Our working assumption is that Netanyahu and Arafat would  
not come to a meeting with the president without having thought 
long and hard about what additional steps they could take,'' one 
official said. 
	 In Paris, Netanyahu said after meeting Albright that he  
would present a ``next-step mechanism'' to his cabinet on Middle 
East peace moves, but he gave no details. 
	 In Jerusalem, Israel's Public Security Minister Avigdor  
Kahalani predicted that Netanyahu's cabinet would hand over 
another 10 percent of the West Bank to Palestinians in the next 
few months. 
	 One Israeli source in Paris suggested to Reuters that  
Netanyahu might have suggested a pullback of about 12 percent, 
far less than the 30 percent demanded by the Palestinian 
Authority, but possibly an opening bid in tight bargaining.
