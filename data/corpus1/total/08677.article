floodwaters over their banks and hundreds of thousands of 
battered East Coast homes remained without electricity Saturday 
as residents mopped up after Hurricane Fran. 
	 Rescue officials blamed the storm for at least 21 deaths in  
the Carolinas, Virginia, West Virginia and Pennsylvania. 
	 Most of the deaths were caused by flash flooding and up to  
15 inches of rain rather than Fran's gusts of wind that reached 
120 mph when the hurricane hit late Thursday. 
	 Powerful tidal surges crumbled buildings along beaches and  
winds damaged neighborhoods far inland before Fran was 
downgraded on Friday to a tropical storm as it entered Virginia. 
	 More than one million people in the Carolinas and Virginia  
remained without power Saturday, officials said. 
	 North Carolina and Virginia were declared major disaster  
areas by President Clinton, making victims eligible for federal 
assistance, although the cost of the damage will not be known 
for days. 
	 Damage in the Raleigh area alone was estimated at more than  
$930 million and officials privately hinted the statewide total 
could exceed $1 billion. In Raleigh, 4,000 homes were declared 
uninhabitable because of severe flooding. 
	 North Carolina Governor Jim Hunt ordered 1,000 National  
Guardsmen and 1,400 state prisoners to help clean up the 
damage. ``This is the worst storm we've had in a long, long 
time,'' he said. 
	 Virginia officials said the famed Shenandoah River continued  
to rise Saturday, creating some of the most severe flooding of 
rural communities in years. Near Washington, the Old Town 
district of historic Alexandria was evacuated late Friday as the 
Potomac River flooded streets with more than three feet of 
water. 
	 The north fork of the Shenandoah River, which slices through  
Virginia's picturesque mountains, was expected to crest Saturday 
at more than 35 feet at Front Royal. The river reaches flood 
stage at 15 feet. 
	 ``This is some of the worst flooding we've ever had,'' said  
Janet Clements of the Virginia Emergency Services Department. 
	 Two residents near Elkton, Virginia, were stranded in  
treetops Friday for eight hours as flood waters rose -- and so 
were the two firefighters who tried to rescue them. All four 
were eventually plucked to safety by a helicopter. 
	 The remnants of Fran caused more misery Saturday when it  
dumped more than six inches of rain on already saturated ground 
in Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania. 
	 The storm left at least 21 people dead in five states.  
	 North Carolina officials confirmed 15 deaths linked to the  
storm, mostly from traffic accidents and fallen trees. 
	 Among the fatalities was one of three Marines swept away by  
raging floodwaters at the height of the storm, the Wilmington 
Morning Star reported. Emergency workers found one of the two 
Marines who survived clutching the branches of a tree in six 
feet of water hours later. 
	 South Carolina reported two deaths, but the toll could be as  
high as seven if investigators determine that a fire in a 
trailer home near Myrtle Beach that killed four children and an 
adult Friday was storm related, a spokesman for the state's 
Emergency Preparedness Division said. 
	 ``It was a bad fire. It happened when the worst of the storm  
was passing through,'' said spokesman Barry Myers, adding that 
it was not yet certain what had started the blaze. 
	 As the remnants of Fran crossed West Virginia, officials  
reported two deaths due to high waters. In Virginia, a woman 
drowned when her vehicle was overtaken by fast-rising waters. 
	 The storm largely spared Western Pennsylvania, but a man was  
killed when his car skidded off a wet road, police said. 
	 Fran hit the coast at Cape Fear, North Carolina on Thursday  
and cut a path of destruction for several hundred miles inland. 
	 At the coast, water surged over low-lying barrier islands,  
filling the streets with sand, shredding ocean piers and washing 
some coastal homes hundreds of feet inland. 
	 Beach communities linked to the mainland by a single bridge  
or causeway were expected to remain closed for a week. 
	 In Wilmington, one-fourth of buildings in the city of 60,000  
were heavily damaged.
