Christopher flew to Saudi Arabia Wednesday to see the carnage 
left by a truck bomb that killed 19 U.S. serviceme, and vowed to 
hunt down the bombers and pursue U.S. missions in the region. 
	 As an unknown group claimed responsibility and threatened  
further attacks unless Saudi Arabia expelled all U.S. troops, 
Christopher visited some 60 people still in hospital from among 
the nearly 400 wounded by Tuesday night's bomb. 
	 He interrupted a Middle East and European tour to fly to  
Saudi Arabia and told reporters the bombing ``will not deter the 
United States from carrying out in any way the mission for which 
it has come.'' 
	 ``It is almost incredible that the loss of life was not  
larger,'' Christopher said as he surveyed torn-up palm trees, 
flattened road signs, shattered furniture and mounds of twisted 
concrete and steel, and the huge crater left by the bomb --  80 
feet wide by 30 feet deep. 
	 The bombing, the worst against U.S. interests in the Middle  
East since 241 U.S. Marines and sailors were killed in Beirut in 
1983, blew off the front of an apartment building in the 
military complex of an airbase in Khobar. 
	 Before leaving Cairo for Dhahran, Christopher said: ``The  
attack emphasizes once again the need for coordinated action 
against the scourge of terrorism. I am both saddened and 
outraged by the attack on U.S. coalition servicemen.'' 
	 In neighboring Bahrain, the Persian Gulf's finance and  
banking center and the administrative headquarters for the U.S. 
Navy's Fifth Fleet, the U.S. Embassy tightened security against 
possible attacks. 
	 U.S. Air Force planes left Germany to pick up some of the  
wounded. The main U.S. military hospital in Europe, Landstuhl 
Regional Medical Center next to Ramstein Air Base in Germany, 
was put on alert, a U.S. Air Force spokesman said. 
	 The U.S. military rushed intelligence, search and rescue and  
other specialists to Saudi Arabia, and the Pentagon said Defense 
Secretary William Perry would fly in Saturday for meetings with 
Saudi leaders and U.S. military officials. 
	 The bodies of the 19 dead Americans will be flown to Dover  
Air Force Base in Delaware Thursday. 
	 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke by telephone  
with President Clinton and offered Israeli medical treatment for 
U.S. soldiers burned in the bombing. 
	 ``(Nentanyahu) mentioned Israel's expertise in this area,''  
his office said in a statement without giving Clinton's reply. 
	 Saudi Arabia vowed ``very harsh and very swift'' punishment  
for the bombers and offered $2.67 million reward for help in 
securing arrests. Roadblocks were set up throughout Saudi 
Arabia's eastern region. 
	 But both Saudi and U.S. officials said they had little idea  
who carried out Tuesday's attack at the King Abdul-Aziz airbase 
in Khobar, the second in eight months against a U.S. military 
target in the strictly Islamic kingdom. 
	 The London-based Arabic newspaper Al-Arab said it received a  
call from a man claiming responsibility for both Tuesday's and 
November's attack in the name of the ``Legion of the martyr 
Abdullah al-Huzaifi,'' but it was impossible to verify the 
claim. 
	 Western officials in the region said they had never heard of  
the group, but a Saudi national with the same name and another 
called al-Hudhaif were beheaded for throwing acid last year on a 
Saudi officer. 
	 The caller vowed that the group would carry out similar  
attacks unless the government expelled all U.S. and other 
foreign troops ``occupying the holy Saudi land,'' home to 
Islam's holiest shrines in Mecca and Medina. 
	 ``The group threatened to undertake further actions against  
foreign military units without exception unless the Saudi 
government yields to the group's demands,'' said al-Arab in a 
fax to an international news agency. 
	 Several little-known groups had earlier claimed  
responsibility for the Riyadh bombing of a U.S.-run military 
training center which Wednesday's caller described as the CIA's 
headquarters in the Saudi capital. 
	 They included Combatant Partisans of God Organization  
(Munazzamat Ansar Allah al-Muqatilah), The Tigers of the Gulf 
and the Islamic Movement for Change. 
	 When four Saudi nationals, none of them named Hudhaif or  
Huzaifi, were beheaded last month for the Riyadh attack, the 
U.S. embassy receieved threats of reprisals against U.S. 
targets. 
	 Across the 16-mile causeway linking Saudi Arabia to the  
island state of Bahrain, the U.S. Embassy said Wednesday it 
was ``reviewing its own security in light of regional events.'' 
	 The spokesman would not elaborate.  
	 Israeli President Ezer Weizman blamed Iran for the attack  
but Tehran denied this and Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud 
Mohammadi, quoted by Iranian television, slammed the United 
States and Israel as ``backers and leaders of state terrorism.'' 
	 Retired U.S. Army Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, who commanded the  
U.S.-led military coalition that defeated Iraq in the 1991 
Persian Gulf War, said violent opposition to the U.S. military 
presence was growing within Saudi Arabia. 
	 ``We have to show them that we're rougher than they are,''  
he said on television. He said it would be ``a tragic mistake'' 
for the United States to pull out of the region. 
	 Condemnation of the bombing flowed in from Persian Gulf Arab  
neighbors and Western allies of the vastly wealthy oil kingdom, 
whose military program has meant lucrative contracts in Europe 
and the United States. 
	 Clinton, who received a telephone call from King Fahd  
expressing condolences, vowed to punish the ``murderous act.'' 
	 Before leaving Cairo for Saudi Arabia Christopher said: ``We  
will not rest until these terrorists are brought to justice ... 
will hunt them down.'' 
	 A Saudi official in Washington promised ``very harsh and  
very swift'' punishment for whoever set off the bomb. 
	 Another Saudi official said: ``Saudi Arabia is determined to  
pursue the criminals, apprehend them and bring them to justice. 
Those who did it will not go unpunished. 
	 He also said the attack would not affect the kingdom's  
strong ties with the United States. 
	 The explosion from a parked fuel truck ripped off the entire  
facade of a residential block and carved out a huge crater 
outside. 
	 Saudi television showed pictures of torn mattresses, mangled  
televisions and furniture and melted video players lodged among 
slabs of fallen concrete as bulldozers cleared away mounds of 
rubble and twisted metal. 
	 The Saudi Interior Ministry and the Pentagon put the number  
of deaths at 19 Americans. The Pentagon said 64 Americans were 
seriously wounded and the Saudis said a total of 386 people were 
hurt, including 147 Saudi nationals, 118 Bangladeshis, 109 
Americans, four Egyptians, two Jordanians, two Indonesians and 
two Filipinas. 
	 Five Americans and two Indians were killed in the bomb  
attack on the U.S.-run training center in Riyadh in November. 
	 Four Saudi nationals were beheaded in Saudi Arabia last  
month for the Riyadh bombing. The government said they were 
influenced by Islamic groups outside the kingdom, including 
dissident Mohammad al-Masari and financier Osama bin-Ladin. 
	 Masari, who is waging a campaign against the Saudi royal  
family, has denied the charge from his exile in London. 
	 Analysts and diplomats said the blast posed the biggest  
internal security challenge to the kingdom in nearly two 
decades, when Muslim militants took over Islam's holiest shrine 
the Grand Mosque and hundreds of people were killed. 
	 ``This shows there are deep feelings of anti-Americanism  
among militants. The fact that they were able to carry out such 
an operation means there may be more in store,'' a Saudi analyst 
said. 
	 Saudi Arabia, like other Persian Gulf Arab states, has been  
mostly concerned with security threats from Iraq and Iran since 
Baghdad invaded Kuwait in 1990 and has increasingly looked to 
its key ally Washington for security assurances. 
	 But homegrown militancy has gained momentum since the Gulf  
War, when fundamentalists were incensed at the influx of half a 
million mostly U.S. soldiers on Islamic Saudi soil. 
	 ``There are pockets of dissent against the Americans and the  
authorities and the two bombs obviously show that these feelings 
are growing,'' said a Western diplomat. 
	 Power in Saudi Arabia has since it was established in 1932  
rested in the hands of the al-Saud royal family. The kingdom has 
remained an absolute monarchy without legislature or political 
parties. Islamic sharia law prevails. 
	 Outrage over the bombing came rapidly from France, Italy,  
Ireland, Belgium, Germany and Russia and across much of the Arab 
world. British Prime Minister John Major called it ``an act of 
pure evil.'' 
	 Squadrons of U.S. F-15s, British-made Tornado jets and  
training aircraft are stationed at the base, which is also used 
by members of the Gulf War coalition to enforce United Nations 
sanctions imposed against Iraq since its invasion of Kuwait.
