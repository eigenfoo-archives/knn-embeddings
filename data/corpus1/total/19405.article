formally sentenced Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh to death for the 
truck bomb attack on the Murrah federal building that killed 168 people. 
	Before the judge made official what a jury found June 13, McVeigh  
walked past his lead attorney, Stephen Jones and faced the bench to 
quote a former Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis. 
	McVeigh said, ``You honor, I want to let the words of justice  
Brandeis speak for me. 'Our government is the hope, the omnipotent 
teacher. For good or ill, it teaches the whole people by its example.''' 
	After McVeigh spoke, Matsch imposed the death sentence saying, ``It  
is the judgment of the court that Timothy McVeigh be sentenced to death 
on all 11 counts.'' 
	McVeigh, flanked by three federal marshals and dressed in a sports  
shirt and khaki slacks, then heard Matsch tell him he would be put to 
death by injection. The Gulf War veteran is the 13th man on federal 
death row. 
	Matsch then asked McVeigh, ``Do you have any questions?'' McVeigh  
responded, ``Not with this court, your honor.'' 
	McVeigh reportedly was transferred to death row in the maximum-  
security federal prison at Florence, Colo. Denver's KUSA-TV said McVeigh 
was taken to the fortress-like facility about 150 miles south of the 
federal lockup near Denver where he was held for more than a year. 
	Jones has 10 days from McVeigh's formal sentencing to file an appeal  
with the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver. He told reporters 
after the sentencing that he had filed a notice of appeal. 
	Jones said it was a ``solemn day of judgment.''  
	In an interview this week with a Buffalo, N.Y., newspaper, McVeigh  
said he wants Jones removed from the case, accusing the Enid, Okla., 
attorney of lying to him. 
	The 29-year-old McVeigh was convicted June 2 of eight counts of  
first-degree murder in the deaths of federal officers in the building 
when he blew it up, and three bombing charges. 
	His alleged accomplice and former Army buddy Terry Nichols is charged  
identically, and is slated to go to trial Sept. 29. Nichols has asked 
for a change of venue, suggesting San Francisco as an alternative to 
Denver.
