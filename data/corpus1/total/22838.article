arrived in Acapulco Sunday to search for victims of Hurricane 
Pauline while distraught family members blamed the government 
for not warning them a deadly storm was coming. 
	 The Mexican Red Cross and private rescue groups equipped  
with specially trained dogs searched for hundreds of missing 
people, some of whom could be buried under the mud and rubble 
that blanket neighborhoods of this Pacific resort city. 
	 Red Cross helicopters flew to remote and poor villages south  
of Acapulco to survey the damage and to look for victims. The 
Red Cross reported earlier that Pauline killed an estimated 400 
people, far more than the 149 the Mexican government has 
reported. 
	 ``We believe there are many more dead in those villages, and  
we are taking a look,'' Ricardo Vazquez, director general of the 
Red Cross in Mexico, told Reuters. 
	 Mexican officials have said at least 149 people died in  
three states and more than 200 were still missing because of the 
storm, which at times was as powerful as Hurricane Andrew, which 
devastated parts of southern Florida in 1992. 
	 The Red Cross estimate of at least 400 dead, first reported  
at a news conference Friday, angered Mexican officials. Vazquez 
said the Red Cross counted most of the missing as dead, while 
the government had added up only actual corpses. 
	 ``Residents are telling us the number of people who have  
disappeared is a lot higher than what is being reported,'' Luis 
Pantoja Rios, director of Caneb, a private rescue company, told 
Reuters. 
	 As Pantoja spoke, a black German shepherd sniffed along the  
splintered logs and smashed concrete where a young boy said he 
last saw his parents during the storm early Thursday. Moments 
later the dog started barking and scratching where a body was 
buried by rocks. 
	 One local woman who lost her sister and two nieces to the  
storm blamed local officials for not taking repeated hurricane 
warnings seriously enough in the day before the storm hit. 
	 ``We knew a storm was coming, but we were not warned that it  
could kill,'' Francisca Silva Juarez, 55, said. 
	 ``I don't think we were prepared,'' agreed Angel Bustos  
Castillo, a priest who celebrated Mass on Sunday for hundreds of 
people on the site where Sacred Family Church once stood next to 
a dry riverbed. ``For my part, I did not know.'' 
	 One news report said Acapulco never declared a maximum  
alert. 
	 ``There was a lack of communication, there was no process of  
alarm, and the (relief) operation did not start on time,'' Red 
Cross official Juan Manuel Lopez Garcia told government 
ministers meeting in Acapulco after the disaster, the news 
magazine Proceso reported Sunday. 
	 Defenders of the relief effort said there was no way to  
avoid damage from a storm as powerful as Pauline, which at peak 
strength produced gusts of up to 160 mph. 
	 Some local residents said people failed to heed government  
warnings, believing they were in for little more than rain. 
	 Tempers have flared on the issue, with President Ernesto  
Zedillo engaging in a public shouting match with opposition 
lawmakers and desperate people mobbing relief centers in search 
of food and water. 
	 Zedillo heard complaints from citizens firsthand during a  
tour of affected areas Saturday in Acapulco. 
	 Unlike other natural disasters, hurricanes are predictable,  
and Mexican officials knew since Monday that a powerful storm 
was lurking off the southern Pacific coast. 
	 By Tuesday hurricane experts were predicting that Pauline  
would crash into the southern state of Oaxaca. Soon after the 
hurricane touched land, experts accurately predicted Pauline 
would skip up the coast on a direct path to Acapulco.
