Albright said she told Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Sunday 
that the United States would pursue diplomatic means to solve 
the crisis with Iraq but ``all options are open.'' 
	 ``We discussed, the chairman and I, the critical point we  
are at with Iraq and I told him we are going to pursue 
diplomatic means but all options are open,'' Albright told 
reporters after two hours of talks with Arafat. 
	 Albright met Arafat in the West Bank town of Ramallah as  
part of a tour of Europe and the Middle East to drum up a strong 
international response to Iraq's obstruction of U.N. weapons 
inspectors. 
	 She said in London Saturday that the time is fast  
approaching for fundamental decisions on Iraq as diplomacy was 
proving unable to resolve the crisis. ``The window is narrowing 
...It looks as if diplomacy is not working,'' she said in 
London. 
	 Albright's talks with Arafat, and a four-hour meeting with  
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Saturday night, also 
focused on modified U.S. proposals on how to end 10 months of 
deadlock in Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking. 
	 ``We had a very good discussion. I am pleased that the  
chairman is studying some of our ideas,'' Albright said after 
the meeting with Arafat.
