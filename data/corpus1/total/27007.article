Airlines plane escaped death when their aircraft crash-landed in a 
marshy field in northeastern Bangladesh, officials said Tuesday. 
   Seventeen people were hospitalized after the Fokker 28 on a  
domestic flight from Dhaka crash-landed five miles (eight 
kilometres) from Sylhet airport at around 10:40 p.m. Monday (1640 
GMT), Civil Aviation Minister Alamgir Khan Mohiuddin said. 
   Alamgir said nobody was killed, "apparently due to (the) ready  
wit of the pilot and crew members." 
   Sylhet airport manager Fazlul Karim quoted pilot M.A. Mannan as  
saying the plane had hit an air pocket at low altitude while 
preparing to land. Mannan is being treated in hospital for minor 
head injuries. 
   The aircraft skidded 500 metres (yards) before it came to a  
halt, with its undercarriage and one wing destroyed, Biman engineer 
Khairul Islam told AFP. The plane was damaged beyond repair, he 
added. 
   Alamgir refused to comment on the possible cause of the  
accident, saying a five-member committee, comprising Biman, civil 
aviation and air force officials, had been ordered to look into the 
incident. 
   "At 10.36 p.m. we got a message that the Biman flight is  
missing.... At around 12 midnight we came to know that it 
ground-landed at a marshy crop field (a) few kilometres away from 
the runway," he told reporters. 
    He meanwhile praised villagers who rushed to help rescue  
personnel from the local airport shortly after the crash. 
   "It was a miracle that no one was critically injured," fire  
brigade official Mozammel Hossain said. 
   "We could not trace the aircraft for more than two hours until  
we got the information that it had crashed in marshland some five 
miles (eight kilometres) away from the airport," an airline official 
said. 
   The airport lies close to a hilly region which is often  
fogbound. 
   "A primary investigation has been ordered," airport director  
Wing Commander Aminur Rashid said. He gave no details. 
   Most of the passengers were expatriate Bangladeshis returning  
from London, the officials said. Many members of Britain's 
Bangladeshi community are originally from the Sylhet area. Of the 17 
in hospital, four were members of the aircraft crew. 
   Additional rescue officials were making their way to Sylhet,  
some 300 kilometres (180 miles) from Dhaka. 
   The F28 was first produced in the late 1960s. The last versions  
of the twin- engined jet were produced in 1986 when it was 
superseded by the F100.
