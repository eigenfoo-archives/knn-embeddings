massed in Beijing's Tiananmen Square Monday as China celebrated 
Britain's return of Hong Kong. 
	 The crowed counted down the last seconds of British rule and  
unleashed a deafening roar when the handover was completed at 
midnight local time. Fireworks filled the sky. 
	 ``I'm so excited... I think my heart will fly away,'' said  
one middle-aged man. 
	 Applause surged from the crowd as the cameras in Hong Kong  
focused on a glum-looking Prince Charles while President Jiang 
Zemin told the ceremony that the day Beijing took back the 
territory would go down in the annals of history. 
	 ``I'm so excited,'' said policeman Chen Baojing. ``We have  
accomplished the recovery of our authority over Hong Kong.'' 
	 China's Communist Party claimed the triumph.  
	 ``The return of Hong Kong to the motherland... has been a  
dream for more than 100 years but became reality step by step 
only under the leadership of the Communist Party,'' the official 
People's Daily said in a front-page editorial. 
	 Late paramount leader and communist veteran Deng Xiaoping  
negotiated the return of capitalist Hong Kong, reaching accord 
with London in 1984 to recover the enclave, seized after Britain 
defeated a weak imperial China in the 19th-century Opium Wars. 
	 ``The return of Hong Kong is very moving,'' said a fireworks  
organiser. ``We have waited 100 years to set off these 
fireworks. For National Day we do this once every five years.'' 
	 Singers belted out saccharine pop songs and children in silk  
costumes pranced on a huge stage dominating the center of 
Tiananmen Square in front of the mausoleum of Chairman Mao 
Zedong, on the spot where in 1989 troops crushed student-led 
demonstrations for more democracy. 
	 A weary-looking member of the group organizing the show sat  
on a curbside. ``This has been very successful,'' he said. ``We 
have been preparing this for 100 years.'' 
	 High above the capital, a blimp proclaimed the recovery of  
the region, bearing the message: ``Celebrate the Return of Hong 
Kong.'' 
	 For the millions who could not make it to Beijing, there was  
the chance to take part in an orgy of celebrations nationwide. 
	 A cavalcade of hundreds of motorcycles paraded the streets  
of Zhengzhou in central Henan province and in the northernmost 
county of Mohe bonfires were lit along the border with Russia. 
	 A choir of 10,000 lined the banks of Shanghai's Huangpu  
river and sang the revolutionary hymn ``Without the Communist 
Party there would be no New China'' and a new pop song ``1997.'' 
	 In the boomtown of Shenzhen, lion dancers, children beating  
drums and flag-waving residents cheered as the first 509 active 
troops of the People's Liberation Army entered Hong Kong. 
	 ``I'm proud for the Chinese people. This shows China is  
strong,'' said Duan Zhihui, a teacher from the Electrical Power 
Institute, watching the fireworks in Tiananmen Square.
