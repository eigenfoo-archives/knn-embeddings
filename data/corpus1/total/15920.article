immigration officials should move to deport a Saudi dissident 
suspected of being involved in a bombing that killed 19 U.S. 
airmen in Saudi Arabia last June. 
	 Federal Court Judge Donna McGillis decided that a government  
certificate declaring Hani Abdel-Rahim Hussein al-Sayegh a 
terrorist and a danger to Canada was ``reasonable'' -- despite 
Sayegh's refusal to testify in the case. 
	 ``The court has satisfied itself that he was involved in  
terrorist activities,'' said Gaetan Blais, a spokesman for the 
Canadian Security Intelligence Service. 
	 As a result, Sayegh will almost certainly be deported,  
although Canada's immigration minister must still decide whether 
he will be sent to the United States or Saudi Arabia. Sayegh 
cannot appeal the decision. 
	 The Canadian government has accused Sayegh of being a driver  
involved in the massive truck bomb in Saudi Arabia last June 25 
that killed 19 U.S. airmen. The bombing, which also injured 400 
people, was at the Khobar Towers, a complex housing U.S. 
military personnel outside Dhahran in the oil-rich eastern part 
of Saudi Arabia. 
	 The government also believes Sayegh is involved in the Saudi  
branch of Hizbollah, a fundamentalist group based in Lebanon, 
court documents showed. Canada believes Hizbollah is using 
Canada as a safe haven. 
	 The hearing Monday was meant to give Sayegh a chance to  
defend himself against the government charges. But Sayegh 
surprised the court by turning down a chance to testify. 
	 ``His testimony in this matter was crucial,'' McGillis said  
as she handed down her ruling. 
	 Sayegh's lawyer, Doug Baum, would not say why his client did  
not give his side of the story. 
	 ``It's a difficult question to answer,'' Baum told reporters  
outside the courthouse. ``It's a deeply personal decision.'' 
	 Baum denied that his client had been advised by the U.S.  
Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
	 But he said Sayegh's silence was not an admission of guilt,  
since the hearing was an immigration case rather than a criminal 
case. 
	 ``There were no admissions or denials,'' Baum said. ``The  
issue today is not his chance to defend himself on the issue of 
guilt or innocence or punishment. The issue today was 
admissibility to Canada.'' 
	 He said his hands were tied in defending Sayegh since the  
court shared only the summary of the government's case with him. 
	 ``I think the evidence in the summary is not up to  
scratch,'' Baum said. 
	 U.S. and Saudi officials have said they want to question  
Sayegh about his links to the bombing. 
	 Sayegh, 28, was arrested in Ottawa on March 18 on the  
grounds that he posed a security threat to Canada. He arrived in 
the country applying for refugee status from Saudi Arabia 
because of what he said was poor treatment of Shi'ite Muslims by 
the Sunni Muslim government. 
	 He has told reporters that he was in Syria at the time of  
the deadly bombing. 
	 Canadian government documents said that of the known  
conspirators in the bombing, Jaafar Chueikhat was dead, 
supposedly after committing suicide in a Syrian prison, Ahmed 
Ibrahim Ahmad al-Mughassil had been identified as the mastermind 
and Sayegh conducted the surveillance and drove the car 
directing the truck that exploded, killing the U.S. airmen.
