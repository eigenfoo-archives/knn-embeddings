Saturday in parliamentary elections that will test the strength 
of hard-line nationalists waging a power struggle against 
Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic. 
	 Western countries pushed for the early elections in the hope  
of ousting the hard-liners, who have defied efforts to enforce 
the country's peace agreement and refused to cut ties to 
indicted war criminal Radovan Karadzic. 
	 Diplomats say the outcome of the vote could determine  
whether the fragile peace in Bosnia takes root. 
	 The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe  
(OSCE) mission, which is supervising the two-day elections, said 
initial reports indicated a solid voter turnout in Bosnia's Serb 
republic but no figures were available. 
	 ``It's too soon to tell in terms of percentages but turnout  
has been good,'' OSCE spokesman Luke Zahner told reporters. 
	 The campaign had been marked by tit-for-tat bombings and  
political intimidation, but the OSCE said the vote went ahead 
without any serious violence. 
	 One incident was reported at a polling center in Kopaci,  
outside Gorazde in eastern Bosnia, where a minor explosion 
overnight shattered a few windows, the OSCE said. 
	 The Western-backed Plavsic dissolved parliament in July  
after breaking with fellow nationalists earlier this year, 
accusing her rivals of rampant corruption and autocratic rule. 
	 ``I expect our people to vote this time for those who are  
able to provide them with a better standard of living and, of 
course, a better future,'' Plavsic told reporters after casting 
her ballot in the northwestern town of Banja Luka. 
	 The president has called for cooperating with major powers  
sponsoring the peace accords and criticized hard-liners for 
consistently defying the West. 
	 Plavsic's arch-rival, hard-line leader Momcilo Krajisnik,  
has portrayed the president as a stooge of foreign powers trying 
to divide the Serb nation. 
	 ``The elections were forced on us and brought anger and  
anxiety to our people,'' Krajisnik said at a polling station in 
Pale, outside Sarajevo. 
	 Peace mediators have accused Krajisnik, the Serb member of  
the country's multi-ethnic presidency, of obstructing proposed 
laws on a joint currency, passport, citizenship and car 
registration plates. 
	 The power struggle between Plavsic and hard-liners loyal to  
Karadzic -- the wartime Bosnian Serb leader -- has produced 
rival authorities ruling western and eastern halves of Serb 
territory. 
	 The conflict has nearly turned violent but Plavsic has  
managed to wrest control of part of the police force and the 
official television network with the help of NATO troops. 
	 The Serb Democratic Party hard-liners and their allies in  
the Radical party are fighting to retain a majority in the 
83-seat national assembly which rules the autonomous Serb 
territory. 
	 The two parties obtained more than 40 percent of the vote in  
municipal elections held in September. 
	 The U.S., which views Plavsic as a pragmatist willing to  
cooperate with peacemaking efforts, has led a Western campaign 
of support for the president. 
	 Western governments have recently injected reconstruction  
aid into her power base of Banja Luka, donated equipment to 
television studios under her control and offered political 
advice to the president's party. 
	 Diplomats said they hoped Plavsic's newly formed party and  
opposition parties would score well enough to build a ruling 
coalition. 
	 A victory for the hard-liners would deal a crippling blow to  
a U.S.-led initiative to salvage the peace process. 
	 If the hard-liners fall short of a majority, they would  
become the first of the three nationalist parties blamed for 
igniting the 1992-95 Bosnian war to be ousted from power. 
	 Such a defeat would also prevent Karadzic from exerting  
direct influence over the Bosnian Serb government. 
	 The peace agreement that ended four years of war in former  
Yugoslavia bars Karadzic and others charged by the U.N. war 
crimes tribunal from any role in politics.
