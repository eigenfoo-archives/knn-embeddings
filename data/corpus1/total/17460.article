Seven summit on Friday, with Japan vowing to block full 
membership for Russia and the United States complaining about 
Tokyo's trade surplus. 
	 The Denver summit promised to be a rarity for President Bill  
Clinton, where he will be able to dominate from a position of 
strength thanks to the booming U.S. economy. 
	 In a scene-setting speech on Thursday, he urged G7  
industrialized countries to follow the U.S. example, 
strengthening their economies by abandoning ``old ideas'' and 
cutting deficits. 
	 He planned separate meetings on Friday with Russian  
President Boris Yeltsin, French President Jacques Chirac and 
Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi before the formal summit 
opening on Friday evening. The other participants are Japan, 
Germany, Britain and Canada. 
	 Clinton and Yeltsin are due to meet several hours before the  
summit for talks expected to focus on European security, arms 
control and Russia's integration into the global economy. 
After a group photo the leaders were to have a working dinner at 
Phipps House, a 1930s red-brick mansion, where Bosnia is 
expected to be the main issue for discussion. 
	 Yeltsin made clear before coming to Denver that his main  
objective was to expand the Group of Seven into the G8, 
including Russia. 
	 ``I do not want to hide from you that if the G8 question is  
finally resolved there, it would be a historic meeting for 
Russia,'' Yeltsin said before leaving Moscow on Thursday. 
	 But Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto immediately  
raised objections, saying Tokyo wanted assurances from G7 
leaders that Russia would be kept out of key meetings on 
financial and macro-economic matters. 
	 Organizers have dubbed the meeting the ``Summit of the  
Eight'' in a nod to Russia. Yeltsin is being excluded from only 
one hour-long economic meeting on Saturday. 
	 Hashimoto said Tokyo wants Moscow to return four remote  
islands in the north Pacific seized by the Red Army in 1945. 
	 ``I would like to input a piece of information in the minds  
of the other G7 leaders that the territorial issue is still 
unsolved and I will ask for their cooperation in helping Japan 
resolve the issue,'' Hashimoto said. 
	 In another discordant note before the summit, Clinton voiced  
concern at a meeting with Hashimoto on Thursday about America's 
rising trade deficit with Japan. The U.S. government said the 
deficit widened by 5.1 percent in April to $4.84 billion, the 
highest gap since October 1996. 
	 White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Clinton pointedly  
reminded Hashimoto that previous persistent Japanese trade 
surpluses had been a source of ``real damage to the bilateral 
relationship'' and said the two nations should not allow trade 
to become the dominant factor in their ties. 
	 They also appeared at odds over the extent of a formal  
consultative process in which they would discuss deregulation of 
key sectors of Japan's economy as a way to increase market 
access for foreign businesses. 
	 U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky told reporters  
Hashimoto had invited the United States to help Japan formulate 
deregulation initiatives. 
	 But Hashimoto was quick to reject any suggestion that he was  
going to let Washington have an advisory or supervisory role. 
	 In his keynote speech on Thursday Clinton underscored his  
country's strength at a time when European nations are battling 
high unemployment and Japan is emerging from years of economic 
difficulties. 
	 He credited ``a new American economic approach that required  
us to puncture myths and push past yesterday's failed debates 
...(enabling) us to move earlier and more strongly than most 
other nations into the new global economy. 
	 ``All the countries in the world face the same choices we  
do. They have to decide: can they reduce their deficit and still 
invest in their people? Can they target people programs, can 
they maintain a social safety net? Can they still grow their 
economy and reduce spending? You bet they can.''
