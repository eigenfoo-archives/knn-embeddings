up an old Jumbo jet in their quest for ways to make planes safer 
from terrorist attack. 
	 The giant jet was almost split in two by the blasts, which  
left the tail section lying crumpled on the ground. 
	 The test, sponsored by Britain's Civil Aviation Authority  
(CAA) and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), was 
designed to find new ways of making aircraft more 
bomb-resistant. 
	 Four bombs were exploded inside the pressurized cargo hold  
of a Boeing 747 in the former U.S. Air Force Strategic Air 
Command base at Bruntingthorpe, Leicester, about 100 miles north 
of London. 
	 The CAA and FAA have been seeking tougher designs to protect  
civil airliners against terrorist bombs. 
	 In 1988, 270 people were killed when a bomb destroyed  a Pan  
Am 747 which crashed to the earth in Lockerbie, Scotland. In 
1989, another 171 perished when a bomb brought down a French UTA 
DC-10 airliner over Niger. 
	 The experiment, part of a five-year $5 million research  
program to improve aircraft structures, was carried out by 
Britain's Defense Evaluation Research Agency (DERA), a wing of 
the Ministry of Defense. 
	 DERA spokesman Rupert Cazalet would not disclose the exact  
size of the explosive charges short of saying they were 
``similar to what happened at Lockerbie.'' 
	 Reports said just under one pound of semtex, a pliable  
odorless plastic explosive, was used in the Lockerbie bomb. 
	 Two explosions were designed to test two new types of  
baggage containers and a third tested a body-armor type of 
protective material in the cargo hold. 
	 A fourth demonstrated the impact of bombs against  
unprotected structures, CAA spokesman Richard Wright said. 
	 Frank Taylor, director of Cranfield University's Aviation  
Safety Center, said these experiments seek to localize the 
damage from bombs to curb the devasting spread of the impact 
which caused the Lockerbie disaster. 
	 Glyn Davies, head of aero structures at Imperial College in  
London, said it would also be possible to toughen the structures 
of the luggage and freight containers that travel in the belly 
of the plane. 
	 Weight constraints have proved an obstacle to ensuring  
maximum protection, but an improvement in both the strength of 
containers and the hull could be the key to minimizing bomb 
damage, Davies said. 
	 He pointed to a Hawaiian-based Boeing 737 which landed  
safely after about one third of the roof had been ripped off, 
and a Philippines BAC-111 which survived two separate bomb 
attempts.
