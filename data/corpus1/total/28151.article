or by truck, dozens of terrorised families fled the mountains of 
western Algeria on Sunday, part of a mass exodus from the latest 
round of murderous atrocities. 
   Behind them was a string of deserted hamlets. The most fortunate  
residents were in the exodus. The rest had been killed in the worst 
frenzy of slaughter seen in Algeria since the Islamic fundamentalist 
insurgency began in 1992. 
   The country's independent press reported over the weekend that a  
fresh wave of bombings, unofficial roadblocks and attacks on 
villages had killed 41 men, women and children in the west and south 
of Algiers. 
   The Ouarsenis mountain range, 250 kilometres (160 miles) west of  
the capital, was the main scene of the violence which since December 
30 -- the start of the Moslem holy month of Ramadan -- has claimed 
at least 600 lives, according to the press. 
   With no official government total available, some unconfirmed  
estimates have put the death toll as high as 1,000 as extremists 
torched homes and wiped out entire families and villages. 
   Sahnine, where 113 people were massacred, was a ghost town. Two  
AFP journalists who arrived in the village Saturday only found human 
remains, graves and stray dogs. 
   "There is no coherent military strategy behind all this," said  
an international official based in Algiers who asked not to be 
named. 
   Several newspapers described the wave of violence as a  
"genocidal" attempt by Islamic extremists to divert military 
pressure on them in the centre of the country. 
   The Ouarsenis attacks were attributed to the main fundamentalist  
organization, the Armed Islamic Groups (GIA). 
   GIA commandos were believed to be exacting revenge on villages  
in an area controlled by a rival group, the Islamic Salvation Army 
(AIS), which declared a unilateral ceasefire three months ago. 
   But many questioned the GIA logic. "It's incomprehensible. Why  
slaughter poor people -- especially those who willingly or by force 
support the Islamic groups," one person asked. 
   The exodus from the villages sitting above Souk el Had has not  
slackened in the 12 days since the wave of killings began. 
   No military reinforcements are visible in the region and no  
government aid has arrived for the survivors, who huddled in 
cramped, makeshift shelters of wood or corrugated iron, rifles at 
their side. 
   Local militiamen and a few "patriots" -- civilians given weapons  
by the authorities -- ensured security at Souk el Had. The nearest 
army soldiers were seen at a roadblock in Ammi Moussa, well before 
the forested heights of the mountains. 
   But at the higher altitudes, villagers were left to fend for  
themselves. They had been asked to leave their homes, but, as one 
said, "we have nothing but our fields, our livestock." 
   Some descend to the better-protected villages to sleep, but go  
back up the mountain during the day to tend their modest plots. 
   Many, though, decided to flee, deaf to army requests that they  
stay behind and arm themselves against the nighttime raids. 
   Under intense international pressure, the Algerian government  
agreed last Thursday to meet a European Union delegation. 
   But it said it would only discuss cooperation in the fight  
against "terrorists" -- the term it uses for the Islamist extremists 
-- and the raising of any other subjects would be seen as unwelcome 
foreign interference. 
   The government has rejected offers of humanitarian aid and  
refuses the idea of a inquiry into the killings. 
   Algiers also protested an exchange by telephone between Rome and  
Tehran over the situation on its soil. 
   It accused Iran and Sudan of supporting the fundamentalists in  
the conflict which has claimed at least 60,000 lives according to 
western estimates.
