Thursday in what a judge said may have been a bid to influence a 
decision as to whether to free jailed presidential frontrunner 
General Lino Oviedo. 
   The bomb was placed in the court's basement archives section  
early Thursday, shattering 50 windows and doing considerable 
material damage, Judge Hugo Lopez told reporters. There were no 
injuries reported. 
   Lopez called the development "very serious," and said it could  
have been an attempt to strike fear into the high court. 
   The Supreme Court was to decide as early as Friday whether to  
free Colorado Party candidate General Lino Oviedo, or confirm his 
sentencing to 10 years in jail for an attempted coup in 1996. 
   A bitter rivalry between President Juan Carlos Wasmosy and  
Oviedo, a former army commander who leads the polls ahead of the May 
10 vote, has raised concerns over possible military unrest or a 
power-grab. 
   In the Chilean capital earlier in the day, a US official said  
the United States would warn Wasmosy on the sidelines of the 
upcoming Summit of the Americas that Washington would not accept any 
disruption of Paraguay's fragile democracy. 
   "We will say that democracy is the only path," Assistant  
Secretary of State for Latin America Jeffrey Davidow said. 
   Wasmosy will meet US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright  
Friday before he meets US President Bill Clinton Saturday, Davidow 
told reporters in Spanish. 
   Paraguay's president has tried on several occasions to postpone  
the elections -- in which he is constitutionally barred from running 
-- by claiming irregularities in voter registration. 
   Oviedo was ordered jailed in December for insulting Wasmosy.  
While imprisoned, he was given a 10-year sentence for an alleged 
coup plot against Wasmosy in April 1996. 
   Oviedo insists Wasmosy's government is corrupt and denies coup  
plotting. The diminutive, quirky ex-equestrian champ known for 
addressing perplexed press conferences in German he picked up at 
military school, is the candidate of the party that has ruled 
Paraguay for 50 years. 
   He is currently trailed in the presidential race by the  
Democratic Alliance's Domingo Laino, a leading dissident during the 
final years of the 1954-1989 military dictatorship. 
   Wasmosy cannot seek reelection but maintains that Oviedo,  
accused by government officials of trafficking in toxic waste, is a 
threat to democracy. 
   Portions of the military back Wasmosy against Oviedo, who would  
be expected to remove his political opponents from the military if 
elected. 
   Pressing the point, army tanks rolled into the streets on  
January 30 and two warplanes overflew the Paraguayan capital as army 
troops loyal to Wasmosy surrounded the First Infantry Division in 
Asuncion, where Oviedo is jailed. 
   Paraguay was under the iron-fisted rule of General Alfredo  
Stroessner from 1954-1989.
