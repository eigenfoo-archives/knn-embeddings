>from  the flight recorder of ValuJet Flight 592 for further clues 
to the cause of the deadly weekend crash, as the toll rose to 
110 with the discovery that one passenger was carrying an 
infant. 
	 Federal officials confirmed the death of the baby, who had  
not been on the passenger list, but gave no further details 
about the infant, the Miami Herald reported. 
	 Scores of grieving relatives of passengers on Saturday's  
flight were to visit the crash site in the Florida Everglades 
for the first time Wednesday for a memorial service. They will 
be taken by bus to the alligator-infested swamp to pray, 
meditate and place flowers. 
	 Workers resumed their grisly search for body parts, plane  
fragments and the plane's cockpit voice recorder at dawn on 
Wednesday. 
	 Some passengers were likely thrown violently around the  
cabin when the DC-9 suddenly lost power and plunged to earth 
after what may have been an explosion in the cargo hold, 
according to data taken from the flight recorder. 
	 Robert Francis, vice chairman of the National Transportation  
Safety Board (NTSB), said the flight data recorder showed that 
the jet was climbing normally after take-off from Miami when the 
problems began. 
	 ``There could have been an explosion,'' Francis told  
reporters Tuesday night. 
	 Of particular interest to investigators, he said, were some  
50 to 60 spare airline oxygen generators being transported in 
the cargo hold back to ValuJet's headquarters in Atlanta for 
refurbishing. Oxygen is highly flammable. 
	 The oxygen generaters are used for passengers' oxygen masks  
in emergencies. Each is the size of a fire extinguisher. 
	 About 3 1/2 minutes before the crash the right engine lost 45  
percent of its power and the plane began to tumble out of 
control, according to preliminary data. 
	 ``The altitude dropped 815 feet,'' Francis said. ``This  
lasted between three and four seconds.'' After the left engine 
lost power, the plane slammed nose-first into the spongy mud of 
the Everglades. 
	 An airplane typically descends at a rate of about 400 feet  
per minute, according to experienced commercial pilots. A fall 
of twice that in less than four seconds would have tossed 
passengers or flight attendants against the aircraft's ceiling 
if they were not strapped into their seats. 
	 Francis emphasized that the flight data collected so far was  
preliminary and would be analyzed further by NTSB engineers and 
scientists. He said it was also significant that the final 50 
seconds of the flight data was missing. 
	 So far dozens of small body parts have been found, but  
medical experts said it could take weeks to identify the 
remains. Dental records, heart pacemakers and small tattoos or 
birthmarks may be the only way some of the victims can be 
identified, they said. 
	 Because of the decomposing bodies, toxic aviation fuel and  
rampant bacteria, searchers must wear special plastic suits and 
face masks to protect themselves from the fetid waters. 
	 The crews are hosed down with water and bleach after  
completing each 30-minute search shift wading through the matted 
vines and muck. A police marksman stands guard with an automatic 
weapon in case of an alligator attack. 
	 Since the accident, questions have been raised about the  
safety of budget U.S. carriers such as ValuJet, which has grown 
rapidly by buying older airplanes since it was founded in 1993. 
	 The White House said Tuesday the FAA was taking immediate  
steps to improve air safety, including accelerating the hiring 
of 100 additional safety inspectors. 
	 The plane that crashed had been forced to return to the  
airport gate on a half-dozen occasions in the past two years and 
a mechanic had been summoned for last-minute repairs to fuel 
pump circuit-breakers on the day of its final flight.
