Tuesday over the government's plans to cut their pensions, clogging 
up highways around several major cities. 
   Around 100 vehicles drove at 30 kilometres (18 miles) an hour on  
the ringroad around Mestre near Venice in the north, bringing 
traffic to a standstill. Traffic was also disturbed around La Spezia 
in the north and Bari in the south. 
   But there was less disruption than feared in the tunnel at Mont  
Blanc at the French border and around Rome. 
   The go-slow, held for three hours in the morning, was called by  
the Confartigianato union to protest the government's plans to 
transfer 1,297 billion lire (750 million dollars) in pension funds 
from independent workers to salaried workers. 
   Italy's parliament on Tuesday approved next year's budget aimed  
at reducing the public finance deficit to to meet conditions for 
taking part in the European single currency in 1999.
