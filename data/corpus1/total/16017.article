big aviation disaster in nearly three years when a Boeing 737 
slammed into the runway of a storm-swept airport in the southern 
city of Shenzhen, officials said Friday. 
	 The death toll could include more than 16 Thai tourists,  
said a city government official in Shenzhen, a booming city on 
China's border with Hong Kong. 
	 China Southern Airlines flight CZ3456 broke into three large  
pieces and burst into flames when it crashed amid the lightning 
and torrential rain of a severe thunderstorm Thursday evening, 
officials said. 
	 Rescue workers rushed muddied and burned passengers to  
nearby hospitals from the wreckage of the three-year-old Boeing 
737-300, which had carried 65 passengers and nine crew from the 
southwestern city of Chongqing, they said. 
	 The Shenzhen city government official said 33 passengers and  
two crew members were killed. Nine people were critically hurt, 
although they were all in a stable condition, and 26 more 
sustained injuries. 
	 Of 25 Thai tourists on the ill-fated flight, only five had  
been found among the injured survivors, the official said. 
	 Four passengers remained unaccounted for, meaning that at  
least 16 Thais appeared to be among the dead, he said. 
	 At least one Hong Kong resident and a Taiwanese were among  
the injured, hospital doctors and officials said. 
	 A Hong Kong man who survived told reporters from his  
hospital bed that the Boeing's pilot had ordered passengers to 
sit near the center of the aircraft shortly before it crashed. 
	 An aviation official said the aircraft crashed after trying  
repeatedly to land on the rain-slicked runway. 
	 ``The plane went around twice after unsuccessful attempts to  
land,'' he said. ``On its third landing attempt the pilot could 
not pull up and the plane crashed.'' 
	 ``The attitude of the plane during landing was wrong,'' said  
a local airline official. 
	 The airliner's co-pilot was among those killed by the impact  
or by the blaze that tore through the aircraft immediately 
afterwards, another official said. The pilot's fate was unknown. 
	 Rescue workers had found its ``black box'' flight recorder,  
but the cause of the crash was not yet clear, he said. 
	 A spokesman for Boeing Co said the U.S. aircraft  
manufacturer had sent a team to Shenzhen to investigate the 
crash, but information had so far proved hard to obtain. 
	 ``It's pretty chaotic out there,'' he said.  
	 The difficulty of gathering information after the disaster  
appeared to be reflected in state media reports from Shenzhen, 
which varied on details, although all agreed on the death toll. 
	 State radio echoed officials as saying that 74 people were  
on board the flight and nine were seriously injured, while the 
Xinhua news agency said 73 were aboard and three badly hurt. 
	 The Civil Aviation Administration of China also sent a team  
to probe the disaster, the first to hit China Southern since 
another of its fleet of about 35 Boeing 737s flew into a hill 
near the scenic city of Guilin in 1992, killing 141 people. 
	 Chinese aviation officials had been celebrating almost three  
years without a serious accident, a record credited to improved 
precautions taken after a Russian-made Tupolev-154 exploded in 
mid-air after takeoff on a domestic flight in June, 1994. 
	 That catastrophe killed 160 people, making it the worst  
reported accident in China's aviation history. 
	 It occurred just months after the International Airline  
Passengers Association cited China as one of the most dangerous 
places in the world to fly after five aircraft crashed in 1993 
and 10 airliners were hijacked to Taiwan.
