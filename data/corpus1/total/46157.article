violate UN sanctions slapped on the country and said there was no 
point holding an Arab summit if such a measure could not be agreed. 
   Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz called on political  
parties across the Arab world to pressure their governments into 
ignoring the embargo imposed on Baghdad after its August 1990 
invasion of Kuwait. 
   "Whether they are in power or not, (parties) should urge their  
governments to take practical measures to lift the embargo," Aziz 
told the official INA news agency. 
   Aziz hailed political organisations around the region for  
organising a series of pro-Iraq demonstrations in the aftermath of 
the December 16 to 19 US and British air strikes. 
   But he also called on the groups to "work from now on to put  
pressure on governments to break the embargo." 
   Iraqi deputies took the same message to a meeting of the Arab  
Parliamentary Union (APU) in the Jordanian capital Amman on Sunday, 
while Iraq's official press said an Arab decision to ignore the 
embargo should be made at a summit. 
   "If an Arab summit takes places, the minimum stand it should  
take is a condemnation of the American and British position and 
action on the Arab level to break the embargo," said the Babel 
newspaper. 
   "If the summit is held purely for form's sake, it would be  
better not to hold it at all," said the daily, run by Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein's son Uday. 
   The paper added that if Kuwait were to attend such a summit "it  
would try to torpedo it and use its influence to ensure (the summit) 
did not take any resolutions not approved by its American masters." 
   The Ath-Thawra daily, the mouthpiece of the ruling Baath party,  
said any Arab summit should "work as hard for a lifting of sanctions 
on Iraq (as it does) to lift those imposed on Libya and Sudan." 
   The Arab League has called a meeting of Arab foreign ministers  
for Wednesday at Yemen's request to discuss holding a full Arab 
summit over the British and US missile strikes on Iraq. 
   Foreign Minister Mohammed Said al-Sahhaf, who is due to  
represent Iraq at Wednesday's meeting in Cairo, arrived in Sanaa 
Sunday to discuss the summit proposal with Yemeni leaders, the 
official Saba news agency reported. 
   He held talks with his Jordanian counterpart Abdel Ilah Khatib  
in Amman en route, Jordanian officials said without elaborating on 
what was discussed. 
   Sahhaf and his Yemeni counterpart are both expected in Cairo  
Monday evening, League officials said. 
   Calls for a summit on the Iraq issue have divided Arab  
governments -- the Saudi daily Al-Riyadh Sunday questioned the 
wisdom of holding a summit when consensus on the issue was 
"impossible." 
   Under ceasefire terms ending the 1991 Gulf War, UN sanctions  
cannot be lifted until UN weapons inspectors declare the country 
free of weapons of mass destruction. 
   Britain and the United States launched four nights of air  
strikes on targets across Iraq in response to a UN report accusing 
Baghdad of failing to cooperate with UN arms inspectors.
