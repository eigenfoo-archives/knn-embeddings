another was sworn in today, marking the first smooth transition in 
a peaceful Lebanon in nearly three decades. 
	Emile Lahoud, Lebanon's 11th president since independence from  
France 55 years ago, was inaugurated after Elias Hrawi's nine-year 
extended term expired at midnight Monday. The last two presidents 
took over after assassinations. 
	With a copy of the Constitution in his left hand, Lahoud took  
the oath of office before a chamber packed with lawmakers, Cabinet 
ministers, foreign diplomats and foreign legislators. 
	U.S. congressmen of Lebanese descent, Republican Ray Lahoud of  
Illinois and Democrat Nick Rahal of West Virginia, were among the 
guests at the ceremony broadcast live on state-run television and 
radio. 
	Lahoud was elected by Parliament on Oct. 15 after winning  
popular support and the approval of President Hafez Assad of Syria, 
the main power broker in Lebanon. 
	A general who had commanded the army since 1989 and rebuilt a  
force decimated by the 1975-90 civil war, Lahoud has pledged to 
clean up government and make the rule of law supreme. 
	Under the constitution, Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's Cabinet  
will automatically resign at the end of the presidential term. The 
architect of Lebanon's reconstruction program, Hariri was expected 
to be named again as prime minister by Lahoud. 
	The choice of Lahoud, a Maronite Catholic, is part of the  
power-sharing arrangement based on religion established with 
Lebanon's 1943 independence from France: the president is Maronite, 
the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the Parliament speaker a 
Shiite Muslim. The 128-member Parliament is divided equally between 
Muslims and Christians. 
	Today marked a transformation as Lebanon recovers from civil  
war. 
	When Hrawi became president in 1989, the state was fractured and  
battles raged between Christians and Muslims. Today, the country is 
rebuilding itself, order has been restored and the armed forces 
have re-established state authority. 
	``It was my destiny to take over a state that was in collapse  
and disarray, and I hand over a unified nation,'' Hrawi said in a 
televised farewell speech Monday night. 
	But Hrawi also said he was distressed at Israel's continued  
occupation of 10 percent of Lebanese territory. Israel has 
controlled a border zone in the south since 1985. 
	Today also marked the first orderly, nonviolent transfer of  
power in the downtown Parliament headquarters since 1970, when 
Suleiman Franjieh was sworn in.
