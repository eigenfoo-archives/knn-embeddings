promised Sheikh Ahmed Yassin that he would free a HAMAS official his 
security forces arrested two weeks ago, in a visit to the home of 
the freed HAMAS leader on Tuesday. 
   When Arafat arrived at his home in Gaza City, Yassin asked  
Arafat in front of journalists to free Mohammed Taha, a HAMAS leader 
arrested by Arafat's security forces in a crackdown. 
   Arafat nodded his head and whispered to his chief of police,  
Ghazi al-Jabali. A HAMAS official on hand, Ismail Haniya, told 
journalists that the Palestinian leader agreed to the request. 
   Arafat embraced Yassin and kissed him in their first meeting  
since the HAMAS founder returned to Gaza City to triumphant 
celebrations on Monday, five days after being released from an 
Israeli prison to Jordan. 
   HAMAS officials on hand hailed Arafat as "the president of the  
nation of Palestine", as both Arafat and Yassin said they would 
pursue greater unity. 
   In past weeks, Arafat's security forces have arrested at least  
80 members of the Islamic Resistance Movement (HAMAS) and closed 
down 16 HAMAS institutions in Gaza in a crackdown launched under 
intense pressure from Israel and the US. 
   Israel demanded Arafat uproot HAMAS from his self-rule areas  
after the group conducted two suicide attacks in Jerusalem on July 
30 and September 4 which killed 21 Israelis. 
   But Arafat's officials have said privately that it was virtually  
impossible for the authority to continue the crackdown in light of 
Yassin's release, which Israel was forced to allow after a spy 
scandal with Jordan.
