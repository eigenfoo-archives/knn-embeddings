Netanyahu as "dangerous for Israel," former army chief Amnon 
Lipkin-Shahak announced Wednesday that he would challenge the 
right-wing premier in May elections at the head of a new centrist 
party. 
   Entering the political ring just two weeks after retiring from  
the army, Lipkin-Shahak told a Tel Aviv press conference he was 
"enlisting again as a citizen to defend the state of Israel against 
threats from within and without." 
   The popular ex-general lost no time in defining the main threat  
as the autocratic and hardline rule of Netanyahu over the past two 
and a half years. 
   But he also tried to set himself apart from Ehud Barak, head of  
the main opposition Labor Party and another former army chief, who 
tried unsuccessfully to recruit Lipkin-Shahak into his ranks. 
   "Netanyahu is dangerous for Israel. Netanyahu must leave," he  
declared, vowing to revive efforts to make peace with the country's 
Arab neighbors. 
   "Today there is neither security nor peace," he said in a barbed  
reference to Netanyahu's 1996 campaign promise to bring "peace with 
security." 
   Turning to Labor, Lipkin-Shahak said the party which ruled  
Israel for much of its history represented the economic and 
political elite. 
   A political novice but with experience as a negotiator with the  
Palestinians and Syria, Lipkin-Shahak, 54, is credited in opinion 
polls with an outside chance of toppling Netanyahu, 49. 
   But many analysts question whether he can weather the rigors of  
a more than four-month election campaign and the combined fire from 
right and left which was quick in coming Wednesday. 
   Netanyahu's office issued a scathing statement denouncing  
Lipkin-Shahak as "the chief of staff of obtuseness" who had no clear 
policy positions. 
   "The people are waiting for some clear words from Amnon  
Lipkin-Shahak about his political ideas," said the statement. 
   Yossi Beilin, a senior Labor politician normally known for his  
soft-spokenness , said Lipkin-Shahak "has nothing to say about 
anything." 
   Barak himself was kinder, calling Lipkin-Shahak "a serious man"  
but adding: "It would have been better to unite our efforts to 
topple the Netanyahu government." 
   Netanyahu was forced into early elections after his right-wing  
coalition collapsed last month, in large part over the stalled peace 
process with the Palestinians. 
   Netanyahu now faces a host of challengers from the left and  
right, including several defectors from his own Likud party, in a 
race which analysts consider wide open. 
   Recent opinion polls show that, while Lipkin-Shahak is the best  
placed candidate to beat Netanyahu if the election for prime 
minister goes to a second-round run-off, he has little chance of 
reaching the second round against both Netanyahu and Barak. 
   In hopes that prolonged public exposure will dull  
Lipkin-Shahak's popularity, the two mainstream politicians agreed to 
hold off the new elections until May 17. 
   In a bid to dispel criticism of his lack of political programme,  
Lipkin-Shahak spelt out his position on Israel's ailing economy and 
the major issues in the peace process in a television interview 
later in the day. 
   Implicitly backing a Palestinian state, he accused those, like  
Netanyahu, who are implacably opposed to statehood, of missing the 
point. 
   "Such a state already exists on the ground," he told the  
privately run Channel Two television. "But as Israelis we can only 
give this state our approval if it meets our security needs and for 
that we have to negotiate." 
   He conceded that that "there will be a territorial compromise"  
with the Palestinians in any final peace settlement. "It's clear 
that some (Jewish) settlements pose a problem," he said. 
   He also said he was willing to make territorial concessions on  
the annexed Golan Heights in order to achieve peace with Syria and 
Lebanon, although he added there would be "no going back" to the 
borders before Israel's 1967 capture of the territory from Syria. 
   But throughout the day he was swift to counter Netanyahu's  
charges that he would give up control over east Jerusalem, which 
Palestinians hope to make the capital of a future state. 
   In a sop to left-wing voters Lipkin-Shahak also attacked  
Netanyahu's deflationary economic policies proclaiming his readiness 
to see inflation go as high as six or seven percent in a bid to cut 
unemployment to six percent from the current 8.5 percent and "put 
smiles back on the faces of the jobless." 
   Lipkin-Shahak named no other members of his as yet unnamed  
party. 
   But he expressed confidence he could forge an alliance with a  
powerful former member of Netanyahu's Likud party, Dan Meridor, who 
last month announced he would also create a centrist group and run 
for prime minister. 
   "It is obvious that there will not be two centrist candidates  
for prime minister, we have to decide between us" who will run, he 
said.
