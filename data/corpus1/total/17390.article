modern Turkey's first Islamic fundamentalist leader, said he 
would ask President Suleyman Demirel later Wednesday to approve 
a plan to revamp the battered coalition. 
	 Deputy Prime Minister Tansu Ciller told reporters at a joint  
news conference with Erbakan that the government would 
``shortly'' come to an end. 
	 ``I will take the agreement which we have reached to the  
president,'' Erbakan said after a meeting with pro-Western 
coalition partner Ciller and a far-right leader. He said he 
would meet Demirel at 6.30 p.m. (11:30 a.m., EDT). 
	 Erbakan held the unscheduled meeting with Ciller at  
Erbakan's official residence in an Ankara suburb, witnesses 
said. 
	 Two deputies from his wing resigned, meanwhile.  
	 Erbakan previously agreed to step down and hand over power  
to Ciller, who would head a caretaker government to take the 
country to early polls. 
	 A spokesman for the Islamic fundamentalists told Reuters  
earlier that Erbakan would probably hand in his resignation 
during his visit to the presidential palace. 
	 Turkish newspapers said Ciller's True Path Party would pull  
out of the alliance if the prime minister did not resign by the 
end of the day.
