seriously injured when he was hit in the head by rubber bullets as 
clashes with Israeli troops heated up in the West Bank city of Hebron. 
	Scores of angry Palestinian youths intensified their protest against  
Israeli settlement policies in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, pelting 
Israeli soldiers in the center of the city with rocks. Others hurled 
dozens of gasoline bombs. 
	At least 20 Palestinians and one Israeli soldier were injured in the  
seventh consecutive day of street fighting between the two sides. 
Israeli troops fired tear gas canisters and rubber bullets to subdue the 
crowds. 
	Fighting began last week, spurred by Palestinian anger over a U.S.  
congressional vote to move that country's embassy in Israel to 
Jerusalem. 
	Palestinians burned American and Israeli flags in the bustling street  
filled with hundreds of bystanders who had swarmed to the city center, 
some to attend Friday prayers at the Ibrahimi mosque. 
	The Israeli commander in the West Bank arrived to survey the scene  
and said that since clashes began, more than 150 Palestinians and eight 
Israeli soldiers had been injured. He stressed that no fatalities had 
occurred and that no Israeli civilians had been injured.
