Florida Everglades where a ValuJet DC-9 crashed, killing all 109 
passengers and crew aboard, a Miami television station reported 
Sunday evening. 
	 Search crews found body parts and transported them to the  
Dade County morgue for identification, Miami's WSVN-TV station 
reported. A dispatcher at the medical examiner's office said she 
could not confirm the report. 
	 Witnesses at the crash recovery scene about 15 miles  
northwest of Miami at the site told Reuters they saw what 
appeared to be body bags carried away just before nightfall. 
	 At a news briefing earlier in the evening, federal aviation  
safety experts said they did not know if any human remains had 
yet been found. 
	 The National Transportation Safety Board investigators said  
they had found the DC-9's two engines and pieces of the tail 
section. Navy sonar experts were to use high-tech equipment on 
Monday to try and find the plane's flight data recorder. 
	 Emergency officials gave up a search for any survivors at  
noon on Sunday, and said they hoped to begin retrieving human 
remains within a day or two. 
	 Luis Fernandez of the Metro-Dade Fire Rescue agency said  
workers stopped their for survivors search when it became 
apparent that no one could have survived the swampy crash site 
because of the difficult conditions. 
	 Federal and local investigators were hampered by murky  
chest-deep water, alligator-infested terrain, and thick deposits 
of mud that some compared to quicksand. 
	 Some 22 hours after the crash, authorities were still trying  
to map the best way to move excavating equipment into the crash 
area, and National Transportation Safety Board experts had yet 
to inspect the scene. 
	 Only helicopters and airboats, flat vessels propelled by  
fans, were able to reach the swampy area where the plane plunged 
nose-first at a speed of nearly 500 miles an hour. 
	 The scene was unusual with little evidence that a large  
passenger jet had crashed. No fuselage was evidence from aerial 
pictures taken of the area on Sunday morning. 
	 An initial plan to build a gravel road to the site was  
called off because of environmental concerns. The ValuJet flight 
went down inside the Everglades National Park, a federal park 
which is home to a variety of endangered animals. 
	 The flight plowed into the swampy Everglades less than a  
half-hour after takeoff from Miami International Airport on 
Saturday afternoon. 
	 Searchers planned to use a levee to move equipment close to  
the crash site, and were considering using pontoon bridges to 
get federal investigators and equipment across the final 300 
yards, Fernandez said. 
	 Authorities were also considering whether to try and drain  
the cratered area, covered with chest-deep water atop several 
feet of thick mud. 
	 ``It's going to be a long, tedious process,'' Fernandez.  
''There's so much water and so much muck out there, we really 
don't know what is left of the plane.'' 
	 A temporary morgue was being set up at a small airport near  
Opa-Locka, a Miami suburb, in expectation that human remains 
would eventually be recovered. 
	 The shallow, slow-moving waters and thick mud hid what  
wreckage remained of the jet. Unlike most jet crashes, which 
scatter fuselage and personal belongings over a wide area, the 
ValuJet and its passengers disappeared with barely a trace in an 
area about the size of two football fields, rescue workers said. 
	 Investigators battled waist-deep water, thick muck,  
poisonous snakes, razor-sharp sawgrass and an oily sheen from 
the airplane's fuel. Rescuers assigned people to watch for 
wildlife and chase off alligators. 
	 Divers unsuccessfully searched the murky waters again on  
Sunday, but were unable to see more than a few inches in front 
them in the fuel-soaked water. They hoped to find the jet's 
flight data and voice recorders to provide clues to the crash. 
	 The largest piece of wreckage recovered from the site was  
the size of a baseball cap, Fernandez said. 
	 The Everglades National Park covers more than 2,000 square  
miles of South Florida, providing a wetlands home to alligators, 
rare wading birds, the endangered Florida panther and manatees. 
	 Air safety officials refused to speculate on what caused the  
crash. 
	 Shortly after takeoff, the pilot radioed the air traffic  
control tower to report smoke in the cockpit, according to the 
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The DC-9 turned around 
and crashed 15 miles northwest of Miami. 
	 Federal investigators said they also planned to interview  
two private pilots who witnessed the crash from the air, and 
said they saw the DC-9 plunge into the swamp at a 75 degree 
angle. 
	 It was the first fatal crash for ValuJet, a discount airline  
which has grown rapidly since it was founded in 1993. The 
Atlanta-based company's low fares have forced other U.S. 
airlines to slash prices in major markets like Atlanta, New 
York, Miami and Washington. 
	 The Everglades was also the scene of an Eastern L-1011 jet  
crash in 1972, which claimed 101 lives. 
	 ValuJet Airline said its flight records showed 104  
passengers and five crew members were aboard flight 592 from 
Miami to Atlanta. The airline issued the following complete list 
of all 109 people on board the DC-9. The dead included two 
British citizens.
