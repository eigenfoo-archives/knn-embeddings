pressed a fierce offensive against Albanians in the embattled Kosovo 
province on Friday, with Albanian sources claiming 20 killed Friday 
and as many as 60 since last weekend. 
   Belgrade's ally Russia meanwhile hit out at "unacceptable"  
western calls for direct intervention in the crisis, condemning 
"terrorist acts carried out by the so-called liberation army of 
Kosovo," a reference to separatist guerrillas among Kosovo's 90 
percent ethnic Albanian population. 
   In another development Friday, diplomats from the six-nation  
Contact Group on former Yugoslavia called on Serbia and ethnic 
Albanians in Kosovo to renounce violence as a means for settling the 
crisis. 
   Officials from Britain, France, Germany, Russia and the United  
States met with Serbian officials and Kosovo Albanians. 
   "We would like to urge all sides to abandon violence and to  
devote all their energy to find a peaceful solution to the problem," 
they said. 
   It also emerged that the UN Security Council could discuss the  
unrest in Kosovo following a ministerial meeting of the Contact 
Group in London on Monday. 
   "The recently reported developments in Kosovo are serious, and I  
believe there are a number of member states who want the matter to 
be kept under active scrutiny by the Security Council," British 
ambassador John Weston said at UN headquarters in New York. 
   The Serbian interior ministry in Belgrade said security forces  
killed more than 20 Kosovo Albanian "terrorists" Thursday and 
Friday, including their leader Adem Jashari. 
   It said a crackdown was continuing Friday, but gave no precise  
death toll for each day. 
   However a Kosovo Albanian official, quoted by the Turkish news  
agency Anatolia, said Serbian forces had killed more than 60 people 
in Kosovo since the weekend. 
   The official, Bujar Bukoshi, a top aide to Ibrahim Rugova,  
leader of the main Albanian party in Kosovo, the Kosovo Democratic 
League, spoke to Anatolia Friday in a telephone interview from 
Bonn. 
   "The Serbian army killed 20 Albanians in fresh attacks today in  
the Drenica region," he said. "Since the weekend, more than 60 
Albanians have been killed in Kosovo." 
   The Albanian Kosovo Information Centre reported that shooting  
was heard around Prekaz village, and that local residents told of 
shelling and large troop movements. 
   One Albanian woman who has family in Drenica told AFP that local  
inhabitants were fleeing towards southern Serbia and neighboring 
Macedonia. 
   "Police forces, tanks, jeeps and military trucks can be seen  
moving incessantly" through the village of Srbica, Adem Meta, head 
of the human rights league in Drenica, said. 
   The offensive follows a similar operation at the weekend that  
left 25 Albanians and four Serbian policemen dead. 
   Kosovo's ethnic Albanians have sought to restore the province's  
autonomous status which was revoked by the Serbian authorities in 
1989. 
   Rugova accused the Serb leadership of waging an "ethnic  
cleansing" campaign against Albanians and appealed for foreign 
intervention. 
   The United States announced on Thursday that it was withdrawing  
a series of concessions it had offered Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic last month to reward Belgrade for cooperating in the peace 
process in neighbouring Bosnia. 
   "The repression that is taking place is totally unacceptable to  
the international community and will have the most severe 
consequences" for Yugoslavia, said US State Department deputy 
spokesman James Foley. 
   In Macedonia, around 20,000 Albanians protested Friday in the  
capital Skopje in support for Kosovo Albanians. 
   "We demand from the international community to intervene  
urgently to end genocide, punishing expeditions of the criminal Serb 
regime," two Albanian parties organising the protest said in a 
letter addressed to foreign embassies in Skopje. 
   In Albania itself, more than 30,000 people rallied Friday in the  
capital Tirana. 
   Yelling "Death or Freedom" and "We will win or die", the  
protestors gathered at the joint urging of Albanian President Rexhap 
Meidani and his predecessor and rival, Sali Berisha. 
   "We are showing our solidarity with our Kosovo brothers and we  
condemn the violence and the barbarity," Meidani told the crowd. 
   Milosevic was, Berisha said, the "Saddam of the Balkans,"  
repeating words used by the Albanian government.
