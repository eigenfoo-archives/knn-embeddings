allies clashed again Wednesday over NATO expansion, with French 
leader Jacques Chirac insisting the cost be ``zero'' and 
President Clinton saying the price would be ``modest.'' 
	 Clinton got his way Tuesday when the alliance invited only  
three former Soviet-bloc states to join -- Poland, Hungary and 
the Czech Republic. A group led by France failed in an effort to 
get Romania and Slovenia also admitted in the first wave. 
	 Still smarting from the defeat, Chirac said Wednesday that  
NATO's eastward enlargement should be achieved at ``zero cost'' 
and France would not pay an extra franc towards the alliance's 
budget to finance it. 
	 German Chancellor Helmut Kohl also joined the fray,  
describing cost estimates issued in the United States as 
manifestly exaggerated in the interests of the 
military-industrial complex. 
	 ``It is completely absurd to link NATO enlargement with cost  
factors as if the aim was to rearm large areas of Europe to the 
teeth,'' Kohl told a news conference after the two-day NATO 
summit. 
	 Chirac also said he was sure NATO would invite Romania and  
Slovenia, excluded from the first wave of alliance enlargement, 
to join in 1999 when it marks its 50th anniversary. 
	 At his final news conference, the French leader said he was  
surprised there had been no real discussion of the cost 
implications among alliance leaders. 
	 ``We took a very simple position, that enlargement should be  
done at zero cost,'' he said, arguing that there was no longer a 
military threat in Europe and the alliance needed lighter 
structures and smaller forces. 
	 ``France does not intend to raise its contribution to NATO  
because of the cost of enlargement,'' Chirac declared. 
	 Clinton told a news conference that the United States,  
Canada and the European allies would have to bear ``modest 
costs'' for building military infrastructure in the new member 
states. 
	 Clinton agreed that not enough work had been done on the  
costs and said many published estimates had been exaggerated and 
the new member states would pay most of their own costs. 
	 The Clinton administration calculated in February that the  
cost of expanding NATO into eastern Europe could be $27 
billion-$35 billion by 2009, without saying how many new members 
those figures covered. 
	 Chirac cited a NATO document which he said estimated the  
direct cost to the alliance budget at $1.3 billion for three new 
members and $1.6 billion for five over the next decade. 
	 The U.S. Congressional budget office has estimated a cost of  
up to $100 billion-$200 billion, while the Rand Corporation, a 
private American think-tank, put it at $42 billion. 
	 Both Chirac and Kohl said armaments lobbies had a vested  
interest in suggesting higher costs to sell their wares to new 
members, but Europe was no longer in a Cold War and NATO's tasks 
now were essentially peacekeeping and crisis management. 
	 ``You can't base your calculations on the assumption these  
countries will create the same kind of military infrastructure 
overnight that for instance Germany has,'' Kohl said, noting 
that that had taken decades to build during the Cold War. 
	 French officials said it was easy for Chirac to say France  
would pay no more, since it contributed just 5 percent of the 
alliance's infrastructure fund and did not pay toward the 
integrated military command, which it quit in 1966. 
	 During the second day of the summit, NATO took another step  
toward redrawing the European security map, inaugurating a new 
security council of nations spanning North America, Europe and 
former Soviet Asia. 
	 Leaders of the alliance and 28 partners formally launched  
the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, an organization intended 
to meet the security concerns of non-NATO members. 
	 NATO also signed a sweeping new security charter with  
Ukraine, sealing the Slav nation's shift away from the former 
Soviet sphere of influence and closer to the Western orbit. 
	 The new grouping includes countries seeking alliance  
membership like Romania and Slovenia, neutrals such as 
Switzerland and Austria, and former Soviet republics like 
Lithuania and Tajikistan. 
	 Russia is also a member, but in a clear sign of protest  
against NATO's enlargement, President Boris Yeltsin snubbed the 
alliance by sending only a low-level delegation. 
	 The council, which will have a secretariat at NATO's  
Brussels headquarters, gives a direct channel of communication 
to NATO in case of any external threat, a forum for political 
consultation and a basis for joint military exercises.
