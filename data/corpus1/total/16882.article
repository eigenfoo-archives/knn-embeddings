across Oklahoma City's bomb-scarred center Monday as relatives 
of the 168 people killed in the worst mass murder on U.S. soil 
celebrated the conviction of Timothy McVeigh. 
	 Scores of bomb survivors and the families of McVeigh's  
victims embraced each other, sang hymns and shed a few tears in 
an emotional evening ceremony just yards from where their loved 
ones were killed two years ago. 
	 Although most said the verdict could not erase the pain of  
their loss, they said justice had finally been served. 
	 ``I am sure there are 168 people who are smiling down on us  
from above,'' Dan McKinney, whose wife, Linda, was killed in the 
bombing, said after the verdict came in from a Denver jury 600 
miles away. 
	 Donna McKinney, who was Linda's niece, said the verdict had  
taken a huge weight off her shoulders and the bombing victims 
had finally found justice. ``We've lost so many people, but at 
least he didn't get away with it,'' she said. 
	 On Monday evening, about 100 survivors and family members  
gathered at the ``Survivor Tree,'' an elm that was badly charred 
by the bomb but managed to survive and that has become a symbol 
of life and recovery. 
	 They sang ``God Bless America'' and some hymns and then  
poured water onto the base of the tree in a ceremony intended to 
demonstrate their grief and hopes of rejuvenation. 
	 Jennifer Walker, whose father, David, was killed inside the  
Alfred P. Murrah federal building, where he worked as an 
environmental officer, said she was relieved the trial was over. 
	 ``This is the first little bit of closure to it all. It is a  
slow process, but that is a start,'' she said. 
	 Many of the families had been at home when the verdict came  
in. Bomb survivor Arlene Blanchard said she had whooped with 
joy, jumped up and down and sung ``Amazing Grace'' to her 
5-month-old son with tears running down her face. 
	 ``Oh, thank you, Jesus,'' Blanchard cried when she heard the  
first guilty verdict on the television set, she said. She was in 
the Army recruiting office of the Murrah building when the bomb 
exploded and suffered back and neck injuries. 
	 Others had gathered at an auditorium on the outskirts of  
Oklahoma City to watch the jury's decision on a two-way, 
closed-circuit feed from the Denver courthouse. They said 
afterward they had stood up and embraced each other as soon as 
the first of 11 guilty verdicts came in. 
	 ``It felt really good. There was lots of crying, and we  
started to cheer before the judge had adjourned, so we had to 
sit down and be quiet again. But it was an incredible feeling,'' 
said Stephanie Titcomb, whose cousin Susan Ferrell was killed by 
the bomb. 
	 Once they were assured justice had been done, more and more  
relatives made their way down to the bomb site, but not all were 
able to celebrate. 
	 ``I thought it would be all joy, but it isn't,'' said Bud  
Welch, whose 23-year-old daughter, Julie, was killed in the 
bombing and who spent most of the day at the spot where she was 
killed. ``It's a very dull victory. The bottom line is that my 
little girl isn't coming back and I have the rest of my life to 
deal with that.'' 
	 Ten yards behind him was the grassy field where the Murrah  
building stood before McVeigh's truck bomb tore it to pieces on 
April 19, 1995. 
	 The chain-link fence that surrounds the site has drawn  
hundreds of thousands of mourners from across the United States 
and beyond. It was loaded Monday with tokens of their grief, 
including flowers, poems, stuffed animals, crucifixes and 
photographs of the 19 children who died. 
	 While the Murrah building's battered remains were leveled in  
a controlled explosion months after the bombing, surrounding 
buildings still stand across the street, their rusting entrails 
spilling out through huge holes in the outer walls. 
	 Most of the victims' relatives want McVeigh to be given the  
death penalty at the end of the trial's sentencing phase, which 
starts on Wednesday, but most concede that that will not erase 
their loss. 
	 ``I supect that even if we get a death penalty, it is not  
going to make me feel any better. We'll have justice, but it is 
not going to change anything,'' said Sharon Medearis, whose 
husband, Claude, a senior special agent of the U.S. Customs 
Service, was killed in the blast. 
	 Nevertheless, survivors and relatives agreed that they were  
at least saved the misery of a mistrial or an acquittal, and all 
praised the jury and U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch. 
	 ``I am very proud of our Constitution, which has shown it  
can provide a trial that is appropriate even for McVeigh. We 
don't live in a vigilante society, and this trial certainly 
represents a civilized nation seeking justice,'' bombing 
survivor Paul Heath said.
