of some Midwestern rivers Thursday, forcing some 
residents out of their homes while others piled sandbags to try 
to keep the rare winter floods at bay. 
	 This month's near-record rainfall of more than five inches  
in northern Illinois has swollen area rivers, breaking through 
levees and swamping several towns. 
	 Liverpool, a hamlet near Peoria in north-central Illinois,  
fought a losing battle to contain rising waters on the Illinois 
River. Several sections of the river were closed to boat traffic 
by the U.S. Coast Guard to prevent wakes from swamping more 
homes. 
	 The river level at Peoria was up nearly six inches from  
Wednesday to more than 25 feet, with the official flood stage 
listed at 18 feet. 
	 ``We have no idea when the Coast Guard will open up these  
areas. It will be based on how fast the high water recedes,'' 
Mike Zerbonia of the Army Corps of Engineers in Peoria said. 
	 Further north on the flooded Rock River, water levels were  
receding quickly around the towns of Hillsdale and Erie. But 
ruined roads and standing water prevented most of the several 
hundred evacuated residents from returning and beginning the 
cleanup, Corps of Engineers spokesman Mark Clark said. 
	 Downstream in Cleveland, Illinois, an ice jam on the river  
was backing up river water into the town, Clark said. 
	 Steady but light rain mixed with snow most of Wednesday did  
not worsen the situation on the Rock River, Clark said. But rain 
runoff from Friday's deluge spilled out of the river this week, 
submerging many homes and roughly 15,000 acres of farmland. 
	 This month's heavy rains, which approached a record set more  
than a century ago, ran off frozen ground into rivers and 
streams that inundated scattered housing subdivisions around 
Chicago and across northern Illinois. 
	 Officials in Indiana and Ohio also warned of possible  
flooding in low-lying areas and road underpasses near 
rain-swollen rivers. Further west, the rising Mississippi River 
had not reached danger levels yet, officials there said. 
	 ``We are about three feet above flood stage and they are  
predicting it to go up a few tenths of a foot a day for the next 
several days,'' Ken Kruchowski of the Army Corps of Engineers in 
St. Louis said.
