President Fernando Henrique Cardoso gave a boost Tuesday to the 
proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas and played down a U.S. 
diplomatic slight that drew Brazil's anger. 
	 On the third-day of his week-long tour of Venezuela, Brazil  
and Argentina, Clinton and Cardoso agreed ``comprehensive and 
balanced negotiations'' toward a free trade area encompassing 
North and South America by 2005 should be launched at a 
Santiago, Chile, summit of U.S. and Latin leaders next April. 
	 The Free Trade Area of the Americas faces obstacles in both  
North and South. Clinton sought to dampen suspicions in the 
region that the United States wanted to drive a wedge between 
the four nations, Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, that 
form the Mercosur trade organization. 
	 Brazil, which is already struggling to cope with rising  
trade deficits, fears any further freeing up of trade in the 
short term could devastate its economy and has urged its 
neighbors to proceed with caution on the free trade area. 
	 ``We believe that these sort of regional trade agreements  
everywhere, if they serve to open borders and increase economic 
activity and promote growth, promote stability and opportunity 
that benefit America,'' Clinton said. 
	 He said it was a ``false choice'' between a free-trade zone  
and Mercosur. ``We believe we can create a Free Trade Area of 
the Americas consistent with Mercosur,'' he said. 
	 Clinton's visit was preceded by a controversy that blew up  
in Brazil over publication of a controversial U.S. guide put out 
by the embassy for businessmen that described corruption in 
Brazil as ``endemic'' and provoked a diplomatic tiff. The word 
was later changed to ``persistent.'' 
	 Clinton and Cardoso, meeting in a city whose modernistic  
architecture rises starkly from the high plateau of central 
Brazil, played down the incident at their news conference in a 
semi-tropical garden outside the presidential palace, beneath 
the shade of a Sibipiruna tree. 
	 ``The document was wrong, and it represented an appalling  
error of judgment .... to write such a thing,'' Clinton said. 
''I can only ask the Brazilian people not to infer that that is 
the feeling of the government or more importantly the people of 
the United States.'' 
	 Cardoso said bureaucratic problems like this usually  
dissolve ``as soon as people see the warmth of our warm and 
direct personal relations.'' 
	``Of course there are always going to be some sort of  
bureaucratic problems but I'm quite sure that we can deal with 
them quite easily,''   he said. 
	 Outside the palace, about 40 demonstrators chanted anti-  
U.S. slogans and waved the red flags of Brazilian left-wing 
political parties before being shepherded away by police. 
	 Shortly before Clinton visited Brazil's Congress building  
for a meeting with congressional leaders and deputies, about 100 
protesters shouted ``Clinton go home'' outside. One of them 
suffered a badly injured hand when a firecracker he was trying 
to throw blew up in his hand. 
	 When Clinton's limousine departed, the protesters hurled  
gobs of animal manure at the limo. It did not disrupt the 
departure. 
	 The two countries signed a range of modest agreements,  
including a partnership to improve education cooperation by 
using modern technology like the Internet, and a $10 million 
U.S. contribution to improve conservation in the Brazilian 
Amazon. 
	 Later on Tuesday, Clinton flew to Sao Paulo, a bustling  
financial and industrial center. On Wednesday he speaks to 
business leaders there before visiting a shantytown in Rio and 
flying to Argentina.
