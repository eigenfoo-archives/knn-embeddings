presidential election does not change the island's status which, 
it insists remains a part of Chinese territory. 
	 ``Taiwan is an inalienable part of China,'' a senior  
official of the Beijing government's Taiwan Affairs Office told 
Xinhua News Agency. ``Neither the changes in the way in which 
the Taiwan leaders are produced nor their result can change the 
fact that Taiwan is a part of China's territory.'' 
	 The Xinhua report monitored in London was the first official  
comment from Beijing since the victory of its bugbear, Lee 
Teng-hui, in Taiwan's first democratic presidential poll on 
Saturday. 
	 For the past few weeks China has been holding military  
exercises off the island's shores in an attempt to cow voters 
into rejecting Lee, who it believes is bent on declaring 
Taiwanese independence. 
	 In a separate report, Xinhua analyzed the results of the  
election and concluded: ``The call for ending the state of 
hostility and developing the relations across the Taiwan Straits 
is increasingly surging on Taiwan island ... 
	 ``The facts show that the broad masses of the people in  
Taiwan demand stability and development of the relations across 
the Taiwan Strait, and cast aside ``Taiwan independence'.'' 
	 Taiwan delivered a thundering rebuff to China Saturday by  
propelling Lee to victory in the island's first democratic 
presidential elections in defiance of Beijing's intimidation. 
	 ``Together, we, the 21 million people (of Taiwan) have  
written China's new history,'' said Lee, 73, in a victory speech 
to cheering supporters waving a sea of banners. 
	 ``This is the most precious moment in history. The big door  
of democracy is entirely opened in Taiwan,'' he added, referring 
to the successful completion of presidential elections denounced 
by rival China as a separatist plot. 
	 Lee reaped 53.99 percent, or 5.81 million votes, after all  
votes were counted, election officials said, quoting preliminary 
figures. Turnout was 76.04 percent of a 14.3 million electorate. 
	 During the campaign, China accused the U.S.-educated Lee of  
trying to promote independence for an island it regards as its 
own province and has slammed him as a ``schemer'' who should be 
tossed into the ``dustbin of history.'' 
	 Taiwan's elections, the first direct election of a leader in  
Chinese history, took place under the glare of the world's 
attention because of Chinese war games designed to intimidate 
the island this month. 
	  On Saturday, China, which is still conducting war games  
just 10 miles from Taiwan islands in the north of the Taiwan 
Strait, branded Lee  a U.S. puppet who was pushing Taiwanese 
into an ``abyss of misery.'' 
	 China has been infuriated by a U.S. decision to order two  
aircraft carrier groups into seas near Taiwan to back 
Washington's warning to Beijing against attacking the island. 
	 The carrier Nimitz passed Singapore and powered into the  
South China Sea Thursday on the last leg of its voyage to link 
up with the Independence battle group to monitor the tensions in 
the 117-mile wide Taiwan Strait, where Beijing this month 
launched live-fire war games following missile tests.
