into the rainforests of Brazil's northern Amazon  Monday as 
authorities deployed more equipment and manpower in a bid to 
tackle the blazes. 
	 About 30 Brazilian army jungle communications specialists  
were sent to remote Roraima state on the border with Venezuela 
as two more Argentine water-carrying helicopters were preparing 
to  join the firefighting effort, bringing the total number of 
helicopters to four. 
	 But Roraima governor Neudo Campos said the firefighting  
operation -- which also involves Venezuela -- was still too 
small and warned that the situation might deteriorate. 
	 ``The situation is extremely serious and it has all the  
elements to turn into a new Indonesia,'' Roraima state governor 
Neudo Campos said. 
	 Fires ravaged large areas of forest in Indonesia last year,  
casting choking smog over much of southeast Asia. New outbreaks 
have been reported this week. 
	 The Brazilian forest fire -- the worst in recent memory --  
began in January when subsistence farmers ignored government 
warnings not to use 'slash and burn' tactics to clear their land 
and watched helplessly as the flames spread quickly over the 
savannas. 
	 Amid one of the region's worst droughts, blamed on the El  
Nino weather phenomenon, the fires are now eating into 
rainforests normally too humid to burn. 
	 Campos said 39,000 people in Roraima had been affected  
either directly or indirectly because of the fires which 
continued to spread through the region. 
	 ``The focal points of fire are increasing and the number of  
men are out there is insufficient,'' Campos said. ``The federal 
government's structure for fighting fires of this magnitude 
needs to be more flexible.'' 
	 Brazil launched a long-awaited aerial attack on the fires on  
Sunday, sending two Argentine helicopters armed with huge water 
buckets to the region of Apiau where fires burning through 
forest and pastures were threatening homes. 
	 Rain, considered the only effective solution to the crisis,  
was due to fall in scattered areas in the south of Roraima on 
Monday but would miss the areas affected by the fires, a 
forecaster at the National Institute of Meteorology (INMET) 
said. 
	 More widespread showers would follow on Thursday, but would  
still not be enough to put out the fires. ``It will be very 
little. It should start raining properly there by April,'' said 
INMET's Francisco de Assis Diniz. 
	 A thick smoke haze hung over the state capital Boa Vista  
Monday, reducing visibility to 1.8 miles  and forcing aircraft 
to land with instruments, a spokesman for the city's 
international airport said. 
	 A hospital this weekend reported the first fatality from the  
fires: a three-month-old girl who died after her respiratory 
illness was aggravated by the smoke. 
	 Some 400 men were combating the fires but the extent of the  
blazes meant they could not prevent flames from eating ever 
deeper into the Portugal-sized jungle reservation of the 
primitive Yanomami Indians. 
	 Reporters and photographers flying over the area last week  
saw fires advancing into the area and rivers dotted with rocks, 
indicating water levels were sharply depleted by the drought. 
	 Firefighting experts said the blazes were particularly hard  
to fight as they were scattered all over Roraima, a state 
roughly the size of Britain, often creeping through undergrowth 
in thick jungle difficult to reach by land. 
	 Environmental group Friends of the Earth (FoE) slammed  
government firefighting efforts on Monday, saying they were 
''virtually nonexistent''. 
	 ``Without a doubt (government efforts) are insufficient in  
the sense that they haven't even properly started,'' said 
Roberto Smeraldi, FoE's Amazon program coordinator in Brazil. 
''There has been no operational response from the authorities.''
