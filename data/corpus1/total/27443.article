Tuesday after riot police using batons, armoured vehicles and water 
cannon broke up a protest here by ethnic Albanian students, 
witnesses said. 
   The Kosovo Information center (KIC), a body close to the leading  
Kosovo Democratic League (LDK), said that the injured, including two 
women and a professor were "seriously wounded" during the clashes. 
   Serb police wearing full riot gear intervened after some 2,000  
people gathered near the town's main square and read a text with the 
students' key demand, the reopening of Albanian language schools in 
Kosovo. 
   Earlier, riot police used batons to break up a larger group of  
protestors gathered along the main street in Pristina, Kosovo's 
provincial capital. 
   One of the Albanian student leaders, Albin Kurti, told AFP that  
police also intervened to prevent a group of around 1,000 people 
which tried to join other protestors. In this group was the 
leadership of the students' union, Kurti said. 
   The LDK said that Serbian riot police used tear gas to disperse  
demonstrators in Pristina and that police had also prevented similar 
protests in five other Kosovo towns. 
   Before the protest began, police carrying batons and automatic  
weapons took up positions in the centre of the city and blocked 
access to the centre with armoured vehicles and water cannon. 
   Many students carried schoolbooks, and whenever they managed to  
gather in a group, read a leaflet with students' demands. 
   "Our protest has no political character. We demand unconditional  
restoration of school institutions," the students' union said in the 
text. 
   Police later withdrew from the streets.  
   The student's union said in a statement that the protest was  
"successful" and added that the "protests will continue until all 
demands are met." 
   Kosovo's ethnic Albanian students are demanding that Belgrade  
reopen Albanian language schools which were closed down seven years 
ago when Serbia stripped the southern province of its autonomy. 
   Belgrade has imposed a Serbian language education regime in  
Kosovo, which the Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the 
population have refused to accept. 
   In its place they have set up a parallel school system using  
private homes and other buildings not recognised by the Serb 
authorities. 
   Though an accord on restoring the schools was signed in  
September 1996 by then Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic and the 
leader of Kosovo's Albanians, Ibrahim Rugova, it has never been 
implemented. 
   Kosovo's 1.8 million ethnic Albanians want independence from  
Belgrade and the right to receive education in their own language 
and manage their own affairs. 
   The protest Tuesday followed a series of similar actions  
organised in recent months and comes against a backdrop of growing 
tension between the Serb authorities and more radical Albanian 
elements. 
   Recently two Serb-run police stations have been attacked in the  
town of Podujevo. Albanian leaders decided last week to hold 
unauthorised parliamentary and presidential elections on March 22. 
   Since the start of this year, 52 ethnic Albanians have been  
sentenced to prison terms ranging from two to 20 years on charges of 
terrorism. 
   Belgrade has been criticised for its blatant human rights abuses  
in Kosovo. Washington has linked reintegration of Yugoslavia into 
the international community to a settlement of the Kosovo problem.
