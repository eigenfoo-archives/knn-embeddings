a West Bank troop withdrawal today by narrowly giving the go-ahead 
to the first stage of the new Mideast peace agreement. 
	It was the first time in nearly two years that Prime Minister  
Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line government had voted to hand over 
territory to Palestinian control. Approval came after a series of 
delays and disputes with the Palestinians that put the pullback 
five days behind the original schedule. It was expected to be 
completed by Friday. 
	Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the two sides have been  
cooperating closely in recent days, after the initial acrimony. 
``We hope the relationship can now improve,'' he said. 
	While the Cabinet debated, Israeli officers showed redeployment  
maps to their Palestinian counterparts. Together, the group toured 
the areas of the northern West Bank from which Israel will 
withdraw. 
	In the first stage of the pullback, 2 percent of the West Bank,  
or 44 square miles, will be transferred from sole Israeli control 
to joint Palestinian jurisdiction. In addition, 7.1 percent of the 
land, 160 square miles, will be moved from joint jurisdiction to 
sole Palestinian control. 
	In Qabatiyeh, a town of 17,000, many residents appeared  
indifferent to the prospect of coming under full Palestinian rule. 
No Palestinian flags or posters of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat 
decorated the streets, as was customary in previous handovers. 
	``The Palestinian Authority does commit certain violations, but  
it's still better than the occupying power (Israel),'' said Ibrahim 
Zidan, a 36-year-old farmer, sitting in an outdoor coffee shop. 
	Fayez Arafat, commander of Palestinian forces in the West Bank,  
said his officers would take control of Qabatiyeh and the villages 
of Tubas, Tamoun and Al-Fara over the next three days. 
	No army bases or Jewish settlements will be dismantled. Instead,  
Israeli troops will move black-and-yellow road markers the size of 
washing machines to demarcate the new lines of division. 
	The first pullback will leave two Jewish settlements, Ganim and  
Kadim, east of the Palestinian town of Jenin, surrounded on three 
sides by Palestinian-controlled areas. 
	One settler said that isolation will prompt some Israelis to  
move. 
	Avner Sinwani said he would leave Ganim, a settlement of 51  
families, if the community turned into a fortified enclave with 
watch towers and barbed wire. ``If we have to stay inside a 
fortress, I don't think anyone will want to stay and raise children 
here,'' Sinwani told Israel radio. 
	Israeli troops also began fortifying settlements today,  
unloading rolls of barbed wire and cement blocks from trucks. At 
the Psagot settlement near the Palestinian town of Ramallah, troops 
built cement trenches, apparently to be used as firing positions. 
	The Israeli government has set aside $45 million for reinforcing  
18 settlements. 
	The United States has agreed to help Israel and the Palestinians  
pay for the cost of redeployment and is negotiating the sums with 
the two sides, said U.S. Embassy spokesman Larry Schwartz. The aid 
would require congressional approval, and the United States might 
impose some restrictions to make sure the money does not go toward 
roads for Jewish settlers or fortifications of Jewish settlements. 
	Israeli media said Israel is seeking $1.2 billion for the  
redeployment. 
	Israel's 17-member Cabinet is deeply divided over the accord,  
under which Israel is to hand over 13 percent of the West Bank by 
the end of January in exchange for a Palestinian crackdown on 
Islamic militants. 
	Only Netanyahu and six of his ministers voted in favor today,  
while five voted against and three abstained. Two Cabinet members 
were abroad. 
	In the first stage of the accord, Israel also pledged to release  
250 Palestinian prisoners. The Palestinians have complained Israel 
is offering to free mostly criminals rather than security 
prisoners, and it was not clear whether the dispute had been 
resolved. 
	A senior Israeli official said the Palestinians would have to  
accept Israel's decision over who would be freed and those the 
Palestinians do not want would remain in jail. 
	Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh confirmed today that the  
Palestinians have met their obligations so far. They published a 
decree against incitement and another concerning illegal weapons, 
and also provided a list of 10 Palestinian fugitives to be jailed 
by today. 
	The armed forces chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, told the  
Cabinet that the Palestinians had already arrested more fugitives 
than required, Israel radio said.
