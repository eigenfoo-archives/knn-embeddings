conservatives defeated in the Islamic republic's election, 
prayed at the tomb of the revolution's founder on Monday. 
	 Moderate Shi'ite Muslim clergyman Mohammad Khatami went to  
Behesht-e Zahra south of Tehran to pray at the mausoleum of the 
late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, spiritual leader of the 
Islamist revolution that ousted the Shah in 1979. 
	 Khatami, accompanied by Khomeini's grandson Hassan, renewed  
allegiance to the late ayatollah's ideas, Iranian state 
television said. 
	 Khatami's election by a landslide Friday was the biggest  
political upset in Iran since the revolution. 
	 Iranian analysts and Western diplomats had forecast a close  
race but none predicted he would crush the establishment's 
candidate, parliamentary speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri. 
	 Khatami, 54, is an Islamic intellectual remembered as a  
tolerant politician when he was culture minister for most of the 
1980s. He is due to take over in August from President Akbar 
Hashemi Rafsanjani, who must step down after completing two 
four-year terms of office. 
	 The presidency is revolutionary Iran's highest elective  
office but the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 
has paramount authority in setting domestic and foreign policy. 
	 Khatami has been moving carefully to stress his Islamic  
credentials since the defeat of Nateq-Nouri, who was quick to 
congratulate his rival. 
	 Both men are clerics with the middle-ranking title of  
hojatoleslam, a lower grade of theological achievement than that 
of ayatollah. But Khatami has a much more moderate view of how 
Islamic mores should be applied, a major factor in his election 
with two out of every three votes cast. 
	 Khatami drove out of the Iranian capital south to Behesht-e  
Zahra on pilgrimage to the burial place of Khomeini, his son and 
those who died in the revolution and Iran's 1980-88 war with 
Iraq. 
	 Inside the golden onion-domed mausoleum, a shrine that teems  
with thousands of pilgrims on Shi'ite Muslim religious 
festivals, a military band played the national anthem and an 
honor guard mounted a salute. 
	 At Khomeini's tomb he laid a huge floral wreath, stepped  
back and prayed. Inside the aluminium and Perspex cage that 
keeps pilgrims at a respectful distance, he prayed again at the 
marble tomb covered in red and green cloth. 
	 An ayatollah's son, Khatami studied theology at the Shi'ite  
holy city of Qom where he joined Khomeini's movement against the 
pro-American Shah in the 1960s. 
	 He wears a black turban rather than the customary white one  
and is addressed by the honorific Seyyed, signs that he is 
believed to be descended from Islam's founder, the Prophet 
Mohammad. 
	 In his first message to the nation on television Sunday,  
Khatami hailed the dawning of a new age ``in the shining history 
of the Islamic Republic.'' 
	 Now, more than ever, the country needed to consolidate  
Islamic values and principles he said. He also stressed the need 
to preserve civil rights and personal freedom.
