ambassador to the United Nations, on Thursday called Iraq's 
decision to expel American arms monitors "unacceptable" and said 
there would be "grave consequences." 
	 "This action is clearly unacceptable, singling out Americans  
that are technicians, that are scientists. Iraq is pushing this 
issue to the brink and there's going to be some grave 
consequences," he told ABC's "Good Morning America." 
	 Richardson did not elaborate, but has repeatedly said that  
military action remained an option. 
	 The official Iraqi News Agency INA reported on Thursday that  
Iraq has decided to expel American arms monitors working in U.N. 
disarmament teams in Iraq and has asked them to leave the 
country immediately. 
	 "Iraq has decided in a statement issued here a short while  
ago following a joint meeting of the Revolutionary Command 
Council and the regional leadership of the Arab Baath Socialist 
Party chaired by President Saddam Hussein that all American 
monitors working in the various activities of the U.N. Special 
Commission should leave Iraq immediately," INA said. 
	 Richardson said the expulsion decision violated a new U.N.  
Security Council resolution adopted Wednesday condemning Iraq 
for banning U.N. arms inspectors. 
	 The 15-member council, in a unanimous vote, imposed a travel  
ban on Iraqi officials responsible for blocking U.N. arms 
inspections and warned of unspecified "further measures" if Iraq 
did not rescind its order to exclude Americans from U.N. weapons 
teams. 
	 The U.N. measure, drafted by the United States and Britain,  
responded to Baghdad's decision on October 29 to ban Americans 
from the hunt for arms forbidden since the 1991 Gulf War in 
which Iraqi forces were driven out of Kuwait. 
	 Iraq immediately rejected the demands, vowing to stick to  
its decision to expel the Americans -- now numbering about six 
-- once the resolution was approved. 
	 "This is clearly violating what the United Nations said  
yesterday, which was restore the full capacity of the U.N. 
inspection team ...," Richardson said. 
	 But despite the unified vote and strong condemnation of  
Iraqi actions, Russia, France, China and Egypt served notice 
that the resolution did not endorse the use of force or they 
would not have backed it. 
	 "Iraq is playing politics," the ambassador added. "They're  
singling Americans out. Who's going to be next? Those countries 
that voted against them yesterday? There is now widespread 
support in the Security Council for Iraq to back off." 
	 Earlier on Thursday Iraq barred Americans from U.N.  
inspections for the 10th time in 11 days. 
	 Iraq has accused Washington of using inspections to prolong  
U.N. sanctions imposed on Baghdad after its invasion of Kuwait 
in August 1990. A clean bill of health is needed from inspectors 
before sanctions can be lifted. 
	 Appearing on the same ABC news program, Richard Butler,  
chief U.N. weapons inspector, said there existed an evacuation 
plan that could be implemented quickly, but first, he said, 
there were questions he wanted answered. 
	 "We have a plan which we can execute to get them out safely  
quite quickly, there's nothing to be concerned about there. 
We'll be dealing with that today (but) I want to know what time 
they say this must happen. I need to know who said this, what's 
the deadline, and react accordingly," Butler said.
