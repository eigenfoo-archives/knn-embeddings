the northern Polish town of Slupsk for the funeral of a 13-year-old 
boy whose death in a clash with police sparked fierce riots between 
youths and security forces. 
   Despite appeals for calm by the parents of the victim, Przemek  
Czaja, groups of youths began hurling stones and pieces of wood at 
riot police, but they dispersed when the security forces failed to 
react. 
   Security forces arrived by the lorryload but sought to maintain  
a low profile during the ceremony which was attended by the wife of 
the Polish Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek, Ludgarda, and other 
high-ranking government officials. 
   Ludgarda Buzek laid a wreath on behalf of the government,  
declaring that her presence marked the solidarity of all Polish 
society with this town stricken with 20 percent unemployment, double 
the national average. 
   The victim, Czaja, was killed in a clash between police and some  
100 fans after a basketball match on Saturday, triggering three days 
of riots in Slupsk. 
   Some witnesses said he was clubbed by a police officer, while  
others said he hit his head on a electric pole while fleeing. An 
officer has since been arrested and charged with manslaughter. 
   According to judicial officials, another officer in Slupsk who  
was not involved in the weekend clash, shot himself dead on the eve 
of the funeral, because he could not face the pressure created by 
the boy's death. 
   Hundreds of supporters of the Slupsk basketball team, Czarni,  
gathered for the funeral with fans of other clubs, wearing their 
coloured scarves in a mark of respect for the victim and of 
solidarity with the youths. 
   The fans stated that they wanted the funeral to take place  
without incident. 
   "We are here to pay tribute to a boy, who was one of us, and who  
was killed, that's all," said a fan of the Legia football club of 
Warsaw. 
   Many of the young people did not enter the church but grouped  
silently outside. 
   But the calm was marred as the cortege left the ceremony, as  
riot police moved to prevent around 1,000 youths grouping together. 
The youths splintered into smaller gangs, scattering into the town. 
Some reports said they went on to daub insults against the police 
and some were armed with baseball bats. 
   Both the parents of the victim and the priest leading the  
funeral, Father Aleksander Duszny, had appealed for calm. 
   "It is time to put an end to these clashes, serious reflection  
is needed," Duszny told the congregation which was made up of mainly 
elderly people. 
   Heads of schools in Slupsk had previously asked their pupils not  
to attend Wednesday's ceremony in a bid to avert the risk of further 
clashes.
