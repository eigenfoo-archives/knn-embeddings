Palestinian in clashes at Ramallah Saturday, the first fatality 
in 10 days of unrest sparked by Israel breaking ground for a 
Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem. 
	 Palestinian hospital officials said Abdullah Khalil  
Abdullah, 20, was shot in the back with live ammunition during 
clashes at the outskirts of Ramallah Palestinian self-rule 
enclave. He was a student at a nearby university. 
	 ``This killing is a declaration of war,'' said Palestinian  
Authority Finance Minister Mohammed Nashashibi, as Palestinian 
ministers prepared for a Cabinet meeting in self-rule Gaza. 
	 After the meeting, Culture Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo  
slammed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 
	 ``Netanyahu is responsible for every drop of blood,  
Palestinian or Israeli, because of his policy,'' he said. 
	 Abed Rabbo said the Authority saw no use in talks with  
Israel ``as long as the policy of expansion, confiscation of 
land and violation of the (peace) agreement continue.'' 
	 Late Saturday, a Palestinian security forces honor guard  
escorted Abdullah's body at his home village of Beit Sahour, 
beside the hilltop called Jabal Abu Ghneim in Arabic or Har Homa 
in Hebrew where the settlement is being built. 
	 Witnesses said several thousand people turned out to receive  
the body. Abdullah is to be buried Sunday. 
	 The death increased fears of an upsurge violence at a time  
when peace moves are threatened by Palestinian outrage over the 
new settlement and Israeli anger over an Islamist suicide bomber 
who killed three women in a Tel Aviv cafe last week. 
	 Thousands of Israeli police, backed by tanks and  
helicopters, were on high alert ahead of warnings unrest would 
peak Sunday -- the annual ``Land Day'' when Israeli Arabs stage 
protests against government confiscation of lands. 
	 Saturday at least 24 Palestinians were wounded when Israeli  
troops fired rubber bullets at demonstrators stoning them at the 
outskirts of Bethlehem, Ramallah, and Bir Zeit in the West Bank. 
Two Arabs were also wounded by live ammunition. 
	 There were also clashes at Qalandya refugee camp near  
Ramallah but no reports of Palestinian casualties. 
	 The Israeli army confirmed a Palestinian was killed during  
clashes and said it was checking the circumstances in 
cooperation with Palestinian authorities. 
	 It said two border policemen were injured by stones in  
Qalandya and an officer was injured by stones in Ramallah. 
	 At Bethlehem, protesters burned an effigy of Israeli Prime  
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu while the Palestinian Authority 
rejected Israel's conditions for resuming peace talks. 
	 Palestinian President Yasser Arafat told reporters in Gaza  
on his return from Cairo: ``Netanyahu's orders and decisions are 
escalating the situation in the whole area.'' 
	 Arafat's adviser Nabil Abu Rdainah said: ``What is needed is  
the implementation of the agreements and the return to the 
negotiating table without any preconditions or restrictions. 
	 ``The new Israeli conditions are not acceptable.''  
	 Arafat convened his cabinet in Gaza Saturday night to  
discuss the crisis. 
	 Netanyahu, after meeting U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross  
Friday, demanded Arafat arrest militants, dismantle guerrilla 
groups and tighten security cooperation. He denied Ross asked 
Israel to make any reciprocal gesture. 
	 Arafat, asked by reporters if Ross in their meeting in Rabat  
Thursday requested him to calm tensions in areas controlled by 
his Palestinian Authority that abut Israeli army positions where 
there have been clashes said: 
	 ``Yes, they are against the violence, especially the  
violence of settlement and the Judaization of Jerusalem.'' 
	 Israel says Arafat gave militants the impression they had a  
green light for attacks. The Authority denies the charge. 
	 Palestinians say settlement building in Jerusalem preempts  
negotiations that are to be held on its status in final peace 
talks which have yet to resume. They demand it be halted. 
	 Europe's Middle East envoy, Miguel Angel Moratinos, speaking  
to reporters after meeting Arafat in Gaza, said political issues 
should be the top priority in peace talks. 
	 ``We have also to convey the security issue. President  
Arafat told me he is always condemning terrorism and 
violence...I'm going to bring this matter to Prime Minister 
Netanyahu,'' he said. Moratinos did not say when he would meet 
Netanyahu. 
	 The Israeli Foreign Ministry Saturday slammed as an obstacle  
to peace a call by a committee headed by Morocco's King Hassan 
urging Arab and Muslim states to reconsider ties with Israel 
over the settlement building.
