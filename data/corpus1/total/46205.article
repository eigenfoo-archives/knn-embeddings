food and supplies to civilians who fled four days of fighting 
between Serbs and ethnic Albanians in northern Kosovo. 
	No clashes were reported Monday in the Serbian province,  
according to a spokesman for the Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe, Jorgen Grunnet. 
	The recent fighting put new strains on an already fragile peace  
accord reached Oct. 12. The U.S. brokered pact ended seven months 
of fighting in the province, where ethnic Albanian rebels are 
battling for independence from Serbia, the main republic of 
Yugoslavia. 
	The ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Information Center claimed 15,000  
people were displaced by the fighting, which erupted Dec. 24 when 
government forces attacked ethnic Albanian rebel strongholds. 
	But a spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency, Maki Shinohara,  
estimated 5,000 were displaced and said humanitarian workers were 
trying to locate them to provide food, blankets and other supplies. 
	Shinohara said teams from the U.N. High Commissioner for  
Refugees had found three villages empty except for fighters from 
the Kosovo Liberation Army. 
	``We're sending our convoys into other areas that we could reach  
... We're not being too optimistic, but we do hope the situation 
will stabilize,'' she said. 
	The ethnic Albanian media center said the death toll from the  
four days of fighting rose Monday to 15 with the death of a wounded 
KLA fighter and the discovery of a civilian's body west of 
Podujevo, 20 miles north of the provincial capital Pristina. 
	In Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Ignor Ivanov said the ethnic  
Albanians provoked the violence to derail negotiations on the 
province's future. 
	``The blame lies with those who provoked these conflicts -- first  
of all the Kosovo Albanians, or, to be more exact, extremists and 
separatists,'' Ivanov said during a news briefing, according to the 
Interfax news agency. Russia has long sided with the Serbs in the 
conflict in the predominantly Albanian province. 
	More than 1,000 people have been killed and about 300,000 have  
been driven from their homes since Milosevic began an offensive 
against the rebels in February.
