blocked activists from converging on Parliament today to protest a 
controversial government assembly that will cast rules for 
Indonesia's 1999 parliamentary elections. 
	Riot officers with sticks and shields stopped buses carrying  
2,000 demonstrators who were waving red and white Indonesian flags 
and yelling slogans against the People's Consultative Assembly, 
Indonesia's highest legislative body. 
	Many pro-democracy activists reject the 1,000-member assembly as  
a haven for cronies of Suharto, the authoritarian leader who was 
ousted after deadly riots in May. The four-day convention on 
election rules opens Tuesday. 
	Fears abound that political tension now will trigger unrest  
similar to those riots. 
	This time, the military has deployed 30,000 police and soldiers  
in the Indonesian capital and warships in the city harbor. 
Parliament resembled an armed camp today, with barbed wire 
barricades and troops patrolling the grounds. 
	President B.J. Habibie, a onetime confidant of Suharto who has  
tried to distance himself from the former leader, wants to hold 
parliamentary elections next May, followed by the selection of a 
new head of state by a newly designed assembly at the end of 1999. 
	The convening of the assembly comes as the world's fourth most  
populous nation grapples with its worst economic crisis in decades. 
	Inflation and unemployment are high, and millions of people are  
sinking into poverty. Rioting and looting over price rises have 
occurred sporadically for months in many areas. 
	In the biggest protest today in Jakarta, 2,000 students milled  
about near Parliament, blocked by police and navy marines. 
	``For 32 years, we've been deceived by the regime. Now is the  
time for the people to voice their interests,'' the protesters 
chanted. 
	In a separate incident, violence flared on one university campus  
when government-backed civilian guards in trucks briefly hurled 
rocks and plastic bottles at students. Police did not intervene. 
	Seventy students also gathered outside the Supreme Court to  
demand that Habibie step down. Police with sticks pushed them back 
and one protester was injured. 
	At another rally, 60 office workers shouted their disapproval of  
the government assembly outside the gleaming stock exchange 
building. 
	In the cities of Semarang, Samarinda and Palembang, hundreds of  
students rallied against the military's prominent role in politics. 
The military, a bastion of support for Suharto when he was in 
power, currently has 75 seats allotted to it in the 500-member 
Parliament. 
	In the city of Mataram, students on one campus demonstrated in  
favor of the assembly. 
	Meanwhile, Indonesian police plan to file banking fraud charges  
against the owners and executives of 13 insolvent banks closed down 
last November by the government, the Jakarta Post newspaper 
reported today. 
	The banks were among 16 closed for exceeding the legal lending  
limit.
