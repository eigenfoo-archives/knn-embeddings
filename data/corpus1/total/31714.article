Wednesday it was sending a team to Kosovo to talk to ethnic 
Albanians despite ruling out such a dialogue a few hours 
earlier. 
	 Albanian leaders in the Kosovo capital Pristina said they  
were taken completely by surprise, and an authoritative Albanian 
source said he doubted that anyone from his side would turn up 
to the talks Thursday. 
	 ``This is not serious. I don't think anyone will talk to  
them at this point,'' the source said. 
	 A Serbian government statement read out on television in  
Belgrade Wednesday said a four-member team headed by Deputy 
Prime Minister Ratko Markovic would travel to the Kosovo capital 
Pristina Thursday for talks on the province's future beginning 
at 1100 local (1000 GMT). 
	 ``The government regards this as an open invitation for  
tomorrow's talks in Pristina,'' the statement said. 
	 But in Pristina a spokesman for the main ethnic Albanian  
political party the LDK said: ``We haven't been invited to any 
talks. We know nothing about it.'' 
	 Local Albanian sources said it would difficult for Albanian  
negotiators to sit down with Serbian ministers less than 24 
hours after burying several dozen victims of a Serb police 
crackdown last week against alleged separatists. 
	 Earlier Wednesday the Serbian government had ruled out any  
dialogue after the LDK said it would agree to nothing short of 
full independence and Belgrade rejected any talks on this basis. 
	 LDK leader Ibrahim Rugova said: ``Former Yugoslavia has  
ceased to exist. Kosovo has its own borders and we have not 
asked for a change of borders. Perhaps Serbia does not think 
that way now but an independent Kosovo is a good thing for 
Serbia.'' 
	 The Serbian government responded by saying the talks, sought  
by the West to calm the situation in Kosovo and prevent it 
spreading through region, could only be held in accordance with 
the Serbian constitution. 
	 ``This is completely against our constitution, this is  
unacceptable for us, and I think this position is unfortunate 
because it does not offer the possibility of negotiations,'' 
Serbian Information Minister Radmila Milentijevic said. 
	 The exchange came as ethnic Albanian villagers exhumed the  
bodies of relatives killed in fighting last week and began the 
grisly task of identifying and re-burying them with Muslim 
rites. 
	 Serbian police and firemen had buried the unclaimed remains  
Tuesday without ceremony after their victims' families refused 
to claim them until they had been examined by international 
pathologists. 
	 Western countries have told Albanians they will not support  
demands for Kosovo's independence but are urging Yugoslavia, 
which is made up of Serbia and Montenegro, to grant it autonomy. 
	 Western sources said U.S. Balkan envoy Robert Gelbard had  
warned Albanian politicians Tuesday that there was no 
alternative to compromise with Milosevic. 
	 ``Rugova should know by now that independence is not an  
option and that continued violence will lessen Western 
support,'' a diplomatic source said. 
	 U.S.-led Western powers have threatened Milosevic with a  
potentially crippling tightening of economic sanctions if he has 
not made progress toward a compromise with Rugova within 10 
days, in particular starting talks without preconditions. 
	 The International Committee of the Red Cross said on  
Wednesday it had pulled its international staff out of Kosovo 
after they received death threats Tuesday.
