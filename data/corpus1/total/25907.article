a historic treaty banning anti-personnel landmines, weapons that 
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien said caused 
''extermination in slow motion.'' 
	 Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy, who lobbied  
tirelessly for the ban over the past year, was the first to 
sign, and Chretien immediately presented Canada's instrument of 
ratification to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. 
	 Officials said 125 countries would sign the treaty Wednesday  
and Thursday, but the world's biggest military powers -- the 
United States, Russia and China -- were only observers at the 
treaty conference. 
	 Most Middle East countries, including Iraq, Iran, Israel,  
Syria, Jordan and Egypt, were also not signing, but most of 
Africa, Latin America and Europe -- including most of the former 
Yugoslavia -- were signing. 
	 ``The most powerful voices here in Ottawa will not be the  
ones inside this conference site,'' Chretien said. 
	 ``They will be the cries of the victims of landmines -- from  
the rice fields of Cambodia to the suburbs of Kabul, from the 
mountainsides of Sarajevo to the plains of Mozambique.'' 
	 The number of signatories is more than twice the number of  
countries that originally backed the ban. Nations have rushed to 
sign on, just 14 months after Axworthy challenged participants 
at a conference in the same hall to return to Ottawa to sign a 
ban at the end of 1997. 
	 Anti-landmine activist Jody Williams told the conference  
that Axworthy's challenge initially had horrified the diplomatic 
community because it went outside the slow-grinding disarmament 
conference at the United Nations in Geneva. 
	 ``Who would have expected that within such a short time, the  
governments of the world would have responded to a band of NGOs 
(non-governmental organizations) calling for a ban on a weapon 
in widespread use?'' asked Williams, American coordinator 
of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, which together 
with Williams in October won the Nobel Peace Prize. 
	 Momentum for a ban built through 1997, and the cause was  
popularized last summer by the death of Princess Diana, who had 
drawn attention to amputees. ``The late Princess of Wales seized 
the attention of the world when she exposed the human cost of 
landmines,'' Chretien said. 
	 Between 60 million and 100 million anti-personnel landmines  
are dotted around 69 countries. They kill civilians long after 
wars have ended and render useless vast tracts of arable land in 
some of the poorest countries. 
	 The landmines kill or maim more than 25,000 people a year,  
mostly women and children. Several victims sat in the conference 
hall, some using crutches, some in wheelchairs and some using 
artificial legs that are key to fuller recovery. 
	 Annan, labeling the mines ``killing machines'', challenged  
the conference: ``We must now turn our imaginations to the cause 
of mine clearance so that the victory of today does not become a 
hollow one.'' 
	 In fact, the conference is building a rehabilitation and  
demining effort Canadian officials are dubbing Ottawa II. 
	 Norway announced it would spend $120 million and Canada said  
it would spend $70 million U.S. over the next five years in this 
area. The Canadian money would concentrate on helping verifying 
and implementing the treaty. 
	 U.S. officials said Washington had devoted about $87 million  
the current fiscal year and more than $100 million in the next 
year. A European Union official said the EU would at least match 
the $138 million spent in the last six years. Japan has pledged 
$80 million over five years. 
	 Axworthy said he might see pledges of $500 million or more  
coming from the conference. Asked if these kinds of amounts 
were enough for such a major problem, he said acidly: ``It's a 
lot more than is there now.'' 
	 As for non-signatories, Chretien said he took comfort that  
some countries were halting exports and production. 
	 The United States is not exporting mines, though China and  
Russia have not made clear commitments to stop their exports. 
	 The Kremlin said Tuesday that Russian President Boris  
Yeltsin had extended a decree banning the export of landmines 
that do not self-destruct and cannot be detected by mine 
detectors. His decree did not cover other types of mines. 
	 A Canadian official said the Chinese position appeared to be  
similar and that Beijing had agreed not to export undetectable 
mines. 
	 Each of the three big powers argued, however, that they  
still needed to use mines in certain situations. 
	 Forty nations must ratify the treaty for it to come into  
force, and Axworthy again said he thought that would be possible 
in about a year.
