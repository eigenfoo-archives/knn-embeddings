to lead the country into monetary union and the new millennium, 
with polls showing a center-right alliance poised to topple 
Prime Minister John Bruton. 
	 Polling stations opened under blustery grey skies at 8 a.m.  
and will stay open for 14 hours in the first time that Ireland 
has elected a government on a Friday. 
	 Bruton challenges history and the resurgent opposition of  
Bertie Ahern's Fianna Fail (FF) and Progressive Democrats (PD) 
alliance to be the first premier to retain his post in 30 years. 
	 The last opinion poll before the vote showed his center-left  
coalition trailing Ahern's center-right alliance by nine 
percentage points after a lackluster three-week campaign. 
	 The electorate has grown by some six percent to 2.7 million  
since a 1992 election, when a 68.5 percent turnout elected a 
government which was formed by Fianna Fail and its erstwhile 
ally, the Labour party of Dick Spring. 
	 Bruton's Fine Gael, Labour party and Democratic Left  
coalition took heart from the fact that the poll said 14 percent 
of people were undecided. 
	 Bruton, in power with his so-called Rainbow Coalition for  
two and a half years, knows history is against him. No Irish 
government has been re-elected for almost 30 years. 
	 But in an assured and relaxed television debate with Ahern  
on Wednesday he voiced optimism that his alliance, which was 
cobbled together when a previous coalition collapsed, would 
confound both history and the polls. 
	 ``This is a partnership that works and I am confident it  
will be returned to carry on,'' Bruton said, echoing his appeal 
to voters to be allowed to continue to oversee an economic boom 
which is the envy of other European countries. 
	 But political analysts said his coalition's performance  
could suffer if his Labour party ally, led by Foreign Minister 
Dick Spring, fares as badly in the election as it has in opinion 
polls which show it losing a third of its 30-odd seats. 
	 Labour, which has held the balance of power in successive  
governments, is expected to be hit in Ireland's complex voting 
system of proportional representation which allows the 
electorate to vote tactically for more than one candidate. 
	 Spring, who brought down the previous Fianna Fail government  
led by Albert Reynolds by withdrawing his support, has been 
vilified by opponents as power-hungry and ready to do electoral 
deals with anyone. 
	 An opinion poll in Friday's Irish Independent newspaper said  
a majority of voters would reject any new alliance between 
Fianna Fail and Labour in the event of a hung parliament. 
	 They were responding to speculation that Fianna Fail might  
turn to Labour to get the seats required to form a government if 
it fell short of commanding a majority with its PD allies. 
	 The Fianna Fail/Labour partnership, already ruled out by  
Labour leader Spring, was rejected by 47 percent of those polled 
with 36 percent for and 17 percent undecided. 
	 The eventual winner must command 85 of the 166 seats in  
parliament. Analysts believe that neither alliance is likely to 
win enough seats to form a government, leaving the ultimate 
outcome in the hands of smaller parties, such as the Greens. 
	 The Green party is fielding more than 20 candidates and  
could find itself courted by both blocs if the result, which 
should be complete by Sunday, shows a hung parliament. 
	 Little separates the policies of the two main coalition  
groupings. Both want to continue the economic boom that has 
created 1,000 jobs a week for two and a half years and to ease 
the tax burden, although they differ as to how to do this. 
	 But Ahern casts himself as a man of the people and the  
government as an unwieldy coalition of convenience which 
exceeded twofold its own target of a four percent government 
spending increase and was profligate with the country's wealth. 
	 He has also promised to kickstart the Northern Ireland peace  
process that was shaped by Reynolds and pressure the British 
government to take decisive steps to get an all-party 
settlement.
