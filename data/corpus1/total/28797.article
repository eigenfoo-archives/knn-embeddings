President Bill Clinton a letter Thursday outlining changes made to a 
Palestinian charter to scrap calls for the destruction of Israel. 
   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had made the  
amendments to the covenant a key condition to be met by the 
Palestinians in strengthening efforts to curb violence. 
   "As far as we're concerned, this issue has been put to rest,"  
Arafat, speaking through an interpreter, told reporters after 
meeting with Clinton. 
   At a meeting in Gaza city in April 1996, the Palestine National  
Council adopted a resolution "annulling all articles which 
contradict the letter of mutual recognition" between Israel and the 
Palestine Liberation Organisation. 
   But Netanyahu is refusing to recognize that resolution and  
insists that specific articles of the charter adopted in 1968 by the 
Council, the parliament of the PLO, must be repealed. 
   Arafat, who said he was encouraged by the talks, was to return  
to the White House later in the day to continue discussions with 
Vice President Al Gore, US officials said. 
   The Palestinian leader said Clinton shared some "new" ideas with  
him on how to break a 10-month stalemate in the peace process during 
the meeting that lasted a little over an hour. 
   "It was encouraging," he said.  
   Arafat lashed out at Netanyahu for accusing the Palestinians of  
not cooperating in efforts to bolster Israeli security, saying that 
it was the Israeli side which has repeatedly postponed meetings of a 
committee chaired by a US intelligence officer to address these 
concerns. 
   Concerning the Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, Arafat  
said he received assurances that all three stages of the pullback 
will be carried out. 
   "The three further redeployments must cover the remaining 60  
percent" of territory, Arafat said. 
   He also refuted claims by an Israeli woman, who was part of  
Netanyahu's delegation to Washington earlier this week, that her son 
was killed by Palestinians who were arrested and quickly released. 
   "The two suspects are in jail in Jericho and anyone can go and  
visit them in jail," Arafat said.
