Nguesso on Thursday arrived in a motorcade in the capital 
Brazzaville from his northern base in Oyo, a week after his Cobra 
militia won a four-month civil war. 
   General Sassou Nguesso, a former military ruler who ousted his  
elected successor Pascal Lissouba with help from Angolese troops, 
rolled into the city aboard an armoured Mercedes, to be hailed by 
his troops and supporters. 
   Driving in from the north, Sassou Nguesso briefly halted his  
convoy of about 50 vehicles and got out of his car at the Kulundo 
crossroads, wearing a grey suit, no tie and just a flicker of a 
smile, to address about 1,000 people who were waving small green, 
yellow and red national flags they had been given. 
   The noisy cortege then went on to Sassou Nguesso's residence in  
the devastated town's eastern M'Pila district, which he had 
abandoned during the course of fierce fighting for the capital which 
broke out in June. 
   Elsewhere in the city, residents were still trickling home on  
Thursday, patiently queuing at roadblocks set up by military units. 
Some of the Cobras had in previous days attempted to put a stop to 
systematic looting of the city by armed gangs, but others were 
themselves among the thieves. 
   Women carrying bowls of possessions on their heads and clutching  
their children by the hands moved along streets, continuing their 
edgy repossession of Brazzaville, abandoned by many of its residents 
during heavy artillery battles. 
   As citizens have returned slowly, they have sought to avoid  
uniformed or armed men in the roads of Brazzaville, which was 
heavily shelled during the war and resounded afterwards to the crack 
of celebratory fireworks and gunfire. 
   The military leader first took power in 1979 and maintained a  
nominally Marxist regime in the former French colony until he was 
defeated at the polls by Lissouba following multi-party elections in 
1992. 
   Rival militias and government forces went to war in June after  
Lissouba sought to disarm the private armies of the central African 
country's political parties ahead of a new presidential poll 
scheduled for July, which never took place. 
   Angolan troops last Wednesday helped the Cobras take the key oil  
city and economic capital of Pointe Noire in the southwest, a day 
after Sassou Nguesso's supporters launched an offensive against 
presidential positions in the south of the devastated capital. 
   Lissouba at the weekend went into exile in Burkina Faso, taking  
temporary asylum offered to him by the west African country on 
humanitarian grounds. 
   On seizing back power, Sassou Nguesso pledged to form a  
broad-based transitional government for the country, following the 
conflict which claimed at least 4,000 lives according to official 
figures, which date back to the early weeks of the fighting in 
July. 
   Other estimates put the death toll at around 10,000, while  
hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced, some of them 
fleeing across the Congo River to Kinshasa, capital of the 
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) on the opposite bank.
