demand that the perpetrators of a pre-Christmas massacre be punished 
resulted in more bloodshed Monday when police in one village fired 
on demonstrators. 
   The shooting occurred in the impoverished Chiapas town of  
Ocosingo after about 500 demonstrators threw stones at police. One 
man was reported killed and two other people were injured, 
authorities said 
   The dead man was identified as a Guadalupe Mendez Lopez, 35. His  
daughter, whom he was carrying in his arms, was one of the wounded. 
   In Mexico City, tens of thousands of demonstrators marched to  
the capital's central square Monday to demand a thorough probe of 
the December 22 slaughter of 45 peasants in the tiny Chiapas town of 
Acteal. 
   There have been dozens of arrests in connection with the case,  
including a town mayor, but Mexicans remain skeptical that all of 
the killers have been caught. 
   There is widespread suspicion that armed "paramilitary groups"  
-- linked to the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) that has 
ruled Mexico since 1929 -- were behind the killing. 
   The town where the shooting occurred Monday, Ocosingo, was the  
site of the worst fighting in the opening days of the Zapatista 
National Liberation Army uprising four years ago this month. 
   Ocosingo and Altamirano, where many of the protesters were from,  
are believed to be strongholds of the Zapatistas, who have spent the 
last four years penned into a patch of jungle near the border with 
Guatemala. 
   Late Monday, demonstrations and sit-ins were reported across  
Mexico. 
   In the capital, demonstrators carried black and white coffins  
and shouted "assassins, assassins" and "enough already" as they 
marched some six kilometers (3.7 miles) through city streets. 
   Some wore black bands and carried candles in support of the  
victims in Acteal, most of whom were unarmed women and children. 
   Other marches and sit-ins reportedly took place in Queretaro,  
Villahermosa, Cuidad Juarez and Durango. In Veracruz and Ciudad 
Altamirano, sit-ins involving hundreds of people began Sunday. 
   In central Rome, Italian supporters of the Zapatistas occupied  
the Mexican tourism office for several hours Monday to protest the 
massacre. 
   Meanwhile, in an appeal published Monday in Mexican newspapers,  
hundreds of humanitarian groups and activists from 15 countries 
urged the federal government to hold peace talks with the Chiapas 
rebels. 
   Late Sunday, the civilian and religious group that brought the  
government and the Zapatistas to the bargaining table last year 
presented a 16-point proposal to rekindle stalled peace talks. 
   Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo named a new envoy to Chiapas,  
Emilio Rabassa Gamboa, on Monday as part of a generalized shakeup of 
a peace commission. The changes had been ordered by Interior 
Minister Francisco Labstida, who himself was named in a 
post-massacre cabinet shuffle.
