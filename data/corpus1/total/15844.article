Mobutu Sese Seko will meet rebel leader Laurent Kabila Sunday 
for peace talks aboard a converted icebreaker, South African 
officials said Saturday. 
	 ``Mr. Kabila is here now and the meeting will start some  
time tomorrow and we hope they will begin to solve their 
problems,'' South African Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad 
told reporters on the SAS Outeniqua, moored in Congo's port of 
Pointe Noire. 
	 Pahad said South Africa's President Nelson Mandela, hosting  
the talks, had a commitment from Mobutu that he would join 
Kabila, who boarded the ship Saturday as his forces closed in on 
the capital Kinshasa. 
	 One diplomat said that Kabila was looking for any excuse not  
to come. At one point, a frustrated Mandela got on the satellite 
phone to the rebel leader and shouted down the line. 
	 Mobutu, who seized power in 1965, has seen his hold over  
Zaire broken by a whirlwind rebel offensive. The rebels, who 
took up arms in October, say they are within 95 miles of 
Kinshasa. 
	 The military governor of the teeming capital asked residents  
to stay calm in the face of the rebel advance and told security 
forces to protect its population without discrimination. 
	 The State Department urged American citizens to leave Zaire  
and warned them not to travel there citing the ``deteriorating 
security and political situation.'' 
	 Previously Kabila had refused to hold talks in Congo, saying  
its president, Pascal Lissouba, was too close to Mobutu. He had 
also said he did not want the talks to start before Sunday. 
	 Officials did not say whether the ship would head for  
international waters as initially planned before talks began. 
	 Mobutu spent Saturday on shore in Pointe Noire after sailing  
into international waters with Mandela Friday for a rendezvous 
Kabila failed to keep, citing security reasons. 
	 South African officials said security on the Outeniqua had  
been tightened, with particular attention to Mobutu's bodyguards 
and the size of delegations. 
	 Mobutu boarded the Russian-built Outeniqua in Pointe Noire  
with great difficulty Friday. Unable to climb 31 steep steps, he 
was driven on board five hours late up a makeshift ramp. 
	 Aged 66 and suffering from prostate cancer, he is one of  
Africa's most enduring strongmen, backed during the Cold War by 
the United States as a bulwark against Soviet communism. 
	 On the battlefront, Kabila's rebels drew closer to Kinshasa  
on several fronts, capturing Mobutu's Lisala birthplace and 
moving beyond Kenge, 125 miles from the capital. 
	 The rebels, who control around three quarters of Zaire, said  
they were moving up reinforcements and heavy weaponry. 
	 Mobutu aides say talks will focus on a peaceful transition  
with elections open to all. They reject suggestions that the 
meeting is a face-saver to allow him to stand down with dignity. 
	 Kabila, 56, says Mobutu must go and has refused to declare a  
truce for the talks. 
	 The United States, France, former colonial power Belgium and  
Britain have troops across the Zaire River in Congo to evacuate 
their nationals from Kinshasa if need be.
