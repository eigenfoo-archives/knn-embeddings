Republic's former Marxist military leader advanced on 
Brazzaville international airport on Sunday and bombarded troops 
loyal to President Pascal Lissouba there with tank and mortar 
bombs. 
	 The barrage, which began with mortar fire at 2 a.m. and  
continued into mid-morning, followed two days of relative calm 
in the capital of the former French colony and diplomatic 
efforts to end over a week of ethnic and political killing. 
	 But at least one mediator played down the significance of  
the exchanges. 
	 ``This is a small incident. These things happen during  
negotiations when sides try to improve their positions,'' French 
Ambassador Raymond Cesaire told reporters. ``There will be more 
incidents like this while there are still men carrying arms.'' 
	 The conflict started on June 5 after the army surrounded  
Sassou Nguesso's home as part of a crackdown on private militias 
and unauthorised arms in the runup to a July 27 election in the 
oil-producing Central African nation. 
	 Former president Denis Sassou Nguesso's Cobra militia moved  
two T-55 tanks towards an airbase held by Lissouba loyalists on 
Sunday and appeared to advance towards the main building in the 
nearby airport, French and other Western military sources said. 
	 ``It is not really conquered ground because it was not  
occupied before but it clearly shows their intention to 
advance,'' one source said of the Cobras' tank movements. 
	 Envoys representing Lissouba and Sassou Nguesso agreed on  
Saturday to meet in Gabon for talks on implementing a peace deal 
-- with deployment of an African force being touted as one 
solution. 
	 Confusion surrounded the timing of the talks. Brazzaville  
mayor and mediator Bernard Kolelas said the envoys would meet on 
Sunday. U.N. special envoy Mohamed Sahnoun and sources in 
Gabon's capital said the talks would most likely be on Monday. 
	 Charles Matoko, Kolelas's director of protocol, said the  
Libreville meeting had to go ahead. ``Even if there's fighting 
at the airport a solution must be found,'' he told Reuters. 
	 Maurice Mavoungo, Lissouba's director of protocol, accused  
Sassou Nguesso of flouting the peace process and said the 
presidency had a delegation ready to leave for Libreville. 
	 ``They must negotiate,'' he told Reuters. ``They are stupid  
if they think they can continue with their coup d'etat. The 
people are tired and what they want now is peace and 
negotiations.'' 
	 Bodies litter Brazzaville's streets and the smell of rotting  
corpses permeates parts of the city. Some sources say the death 
toll could run into hundreds and maybe even several thousand but 
many of the dead lay uncollected where they fell. 
	 The two sides declared a truce on Wednesday and it seemed to  
take hold in most parts of the city on Friday and Saturday. 
	 France, which has evacuated almost 5,000 foreign nationals,  
about a third of them French, said it would wind up its rescue 
mission later on Sunday and start pulling out. 
	 Kolelas aides and Lissouba have floated the idea of French  
troops staying. Sassou Nguesso is cooler on the idea. Both 
Lissouba and Sassou Nguesso say they want the poll to go ahead. 
	 ``We must do everything to ensure that the elections are  
held within the delays foreseen in the constitution,'' Sahnoun 
said on Saturday after talks with all sides. ``Democracy must 
definitely be put back on track.'' Lissouba's mandate ends on 
August 31.
