future under Chinese rule, Thursday bitterly accused the United 
States and Britain of betrayal for softening their stand against 
a Beijing-picked legislature. 
	 Britain's chief diplomat in Hong Kong insisted, however,  
London had not eased its opposition to the unelected assembly 
that China plans to install on its July 1 takeover of the 
British colony. 
	 Trade Commissioner Francis Cornish, soon to become  
Consul-General, told reporters Britain hoped the Provisional 
Legislature would have a short lifespan and his decision to 
attend its swearing-in ceremony was not an endorsement. 
	 Political analysts had earlier described the decision by the  
two countries to send their top Hong Kong envoys to the 
swearing-in of new lawmakers as a pragmatic move to protect 
their business interests in booming China. 
	 Emily Lau, an outspoken champion of democracy, condemned  
London and Washington as ``disgusting and contemptible.'' 
	 ``I am not surprised,'' she said of the decision, which  
severely blunts the impact of a boycott of the ceremony by 
visiting U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and British 
Prime Minister Tony Blair. 
	 Democratic Party leader Martin Lee said the original message  
that Britain and the United States would not accept the 
legitimacy of the new chamber ``is much watered down, if not 
contradicted.'' 
	 The provisional legislature, to be sworn in shortly after  
Monday's midnight handover ceremony, replaces a democratically 
elected body to which Lee and Lau belong. Both will be excluded 
from the new body. 
	 Cornish, speaking to reporters in Hong Kong, was adamant  
however that London's decision to send officials to the 
swearing-in ceremony was not a climbdown. 
	 ``Nothing will persuade the British government that the  
dismissal of the Legislative Council is anything other than a 
step in the wrong direction,'' he said. 
	 ``It means no weakening of our attitude or position towards  
the Provisional Legislature which we hope and expect will be 
replaced as soon as possible with an election,'' Cornish said. 
	 He said Britain wanted to see ``a properly constituted  
Legislative Council'' in conformity with the Basic Law, the 
territory's future constitution drawn up by China. 
	 Cornish said he would attend the event because future leader  
Tung Chee-hwa would be sworn in at the same time, as would his 
principal government officers and the judiciary. 
	 ``These are individuals and institutions which we support  
and which we want to work very closely with,'' Cornish said. 
	  British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said he and his  
counterparts at an EU meeting in Luxembourg on Thursday 
unanimously agreed a statement calling on China to meet its 
pledge to hold legislative elections within a year of the 
takeover. 
	 ``We want to make sure that Hong Kong can boast a prosperous  
economy and also maintain its freedoms and liberties,'' he said. 
	 ``If at any stage there appears to be any retreat (from the  
pledge), we now have a basis a for strong support from 
throughout the European Union.'' 
	 The EU took no position on joining Britain in a ministerial  
boycott of the swearing-in of the legislature. Cook said, 
however, attendance of the ceremony by ministers from some EU 
countries was still ``an open question.'' 
	 Britain, its EU partners and the United States all have huge  
investments in Hong Kong, a gateway to the China trade. 
	 Underlining the commercial realities that lie behind the  
current furious political debate, Hong Kong stocks on Thursday 
continued their surge on ``handover fever.'' The biggest gainers 
were ``red chip'' companies backed by Beijing. 
	 Preparations went ahead for the end-of-empire party, a  
Hollywood-style extravaganza that will light up Hong Kong skies 
with fireworks and fill the air with the sounds of symphony 
orchestras, dragon-dance drums, military bands and mass karaoke. 
	 Fireworks barges were towed into place, and police frogmen  
scoured the harbor for bombs in preparation for the arrival of 
dozens of dignitaries, including Chinese President Jiang Zemin 
and Britain's heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles. 
	 Political analysts said that the flip-flop over the  
swearing-in ceremony had left outgoing colonial governor Chris 
Patten's tough pro-democracy campaign against China in shreds.
