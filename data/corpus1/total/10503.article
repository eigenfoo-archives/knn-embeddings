Salinger said Thursday that a U.S. Navy missile accidentally 
shot down the TWA airliner which crashed off New York in July 
killing all 230 people aboard. 
	 Salinger told airline officials at a meeting here that an  
agent of the U.S. Secret Service gave him a document in Paris 
showing the airliner had entered an area where the U.S. Navy was 
carrying out missile tests. 
	 ``The airliner was not the target of an attack...It was shot  
down by a missile fired from a U.S. Navy vessel,'' he said. 
	 He said the airliner had taken off late from New York and  
was flying lower than its scheduled altitude of 20,000 feet to 
steer clear of another aircraft. 
	 The airport control tower, in ``a tragic error,'' failed to  
inform the Navy, Salinger said. 
	 ``The truth must come out,'' he said.  
	 In Washington Thursday night, a Navy spokesman at the  
Pentagon denied that a U.S. missile had accidentally brought 
down the jumbo jet. 
	 He pointed out that the U.S. military, the Federal Bureau of  
Investiogation and the National Transportation Safety Board, all 
had rejected similar suggestions in the past. 
	 A spokesman in New York for the FBI, which has been  
investigating the crash, also denied the suggestion Thursday 
night. 
	 ``We are not familiar with what Mr Salinger has said....Our  
investigation so far has not revealed any evidence that a 
so-called friendly fire situation brought down TWA flight 800,'' 
said Joe Valiquette, the FBI spokesman. 
	 Salinger, 71, was press spokesman for the late president  
John F. Kennedy and later Paris bureau for the U.S. television 
network ABC. 
	 He made his comments to some 100 airline officials from 20  
countries attending a meeting in the French Mediterranean resort 
of Cannes. 
	 He said he had passed on his information to an unspecified  
U.S. television network which did not broadcast it. He accused 
the U.S. government of clamping a news blackout on the crash. 
	 Investigators are still dredging the seabed off Long Island  
for evidence to explain the crash. They have established that a 
fuel tank exploded but not what set off the blast and there has 
been no official verdict on the disaster. 
	 A missile, a bomb and a mechanical fault have all been  
suggested.
