earthquake rose to nearly 2,400 Sunday as rescue teams dug 
through thousands of flattened houses and grieving relatives 
wailed and sobbed. 
	 The number of injured was 6,000, the official news agency  
IRNA said in a report from Mashhad, capital of quake-stricken 
Khorasan province bordering Afghanistan and Tajikistan. 
	 Some 2,000 of the dead were from villages around Qaen, 394  
from the city of Birjand and two from a nearby town, it said. 
	 Interior Minister Ali Mohammad Besharati said in Tehran that  
initial estimates put the extent of destruction in the two 
heavily damaged cities at 200 billion rials ($67 million). 
	 A United Nations official flew to the scene to assess damage  
and report on aid needed to cope with the aftermath of the force 
7.1 earthquake, which left thousands homeless and was Iran's 
most severe since 1990 when about 35,000 died. 
	 Amid scenes of death and devastation, rescue teams brought  
out more bodies as villagers clawed through the rubble of homes 
for survivors. 
	 Children, including toddlers crying, wandered aimlessly  
among the rubble of Qaen close to the quake's epicentre. 
	 Some villages were completely levelled by the quake and  
villagers digging with shovels and their bare hands brought 
broken bodies out from the debris slung in sheets. 
	 The total despair was palpable in the villages where  
survivors said they were still trying to grapple with the 
enormity of the disaster. 
	 A make-shift clinic including an operating theater set up in  
a sports hall in Qaen was filled with survivors, some on drip 
feeds. 
	 Equipment for three field hospitals was sent to the area  
where some 10,000 houses were estimated to have been destroyed. 
	 Tehran radio said 2,000 relief workers using 300 vehicles  
were taking part in the relief work. 
	 A U.N. spokesman in the capital Tehran said a U.N. official  
who flew to the region Sunday was expected to report on Monday 
to the world body's headquarters in New York. 
	 His assessment could trigger a flow of aid in response to  
Iran's appeal for international help to cope with the disaster. 
	 The Saudi-based Organization of the Islamic Conference,  
appealed to its 52 member states to extend all forms of urgent 
humanitarian assistance to Iran to help it cope with the 
disaster. 
	 The United States and France have also indicated they would  
consider helping, but a White House spokesman said Saturday the 
first step was for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and other 
organizations to assess damage. 
	 Iran's deputy interior minister for natural disasters Rasul  
Zargar told the radio there was urgent need for food, blankets, 
tents, clothing and cooking equipment. He said rescuers had 
assessed damage in 148 villages with a population of 50,000. 
	 He said six C-130 Hercules transport aircraft loaded with 80  
tonnes of basic goods and other aid were ready to fly to the 
quake zone and four helicopters also had been allocated to help. 
	 Iran has sent nearly 500 rescue teams to the devastated area  
outside the cities of Qaen and Birjand to look for survivors. 
Army units were transporting blankets, tents and food to the 
agricultural region known for its saffron production. 
	 Iran's interior ministry appealed for international  
humanitarian aid, saying Iran's relief agencies were ``ready to 
receive assistance from those countries that would like to 
assist the earthquake victims,'' the radio said. 
	 It said Iran was willing to set up a center for victims of  
the quake in the city of Herat in neighboring Afghanistan and 
help transport relief supplies to them. 
	 Some 130 aftershocks shook Qaen and Birjand in 22 hours  
after the quake which hit the area shortly after midday on 
Saturday, also cutting off rural power and water supplies, the 
radio said. 
	 The quake also jolted Mashhad, Iran's second largest city  
with a population of about two million, 370 km (230 miles) 
northwest of the earthquake's epicentre.
