Jospin pledged Thursday a four percent rise in the national 
minimum wage, offering what he said would be the biggest boost 
in purchasing power for the low-paid in 15 years. 
	 Jospin, swept to power in an upset election win three weeks  
ago, told parliament he would give ``absolute priority'' to a 
campaign pledge to find 700,000 jobs for young people and 
promised to call a national jobs conference for September. 
	 ``The government will propose...an increase of four percent  
in the SMIC (minimum wage),'' Jospin said in his first major 
policy speech since taking office. ``Based on a rise in prices 
of well below one percent, this is the biggest rise in 
purchasing power for 15 years.'' 
	 The increase will affect some two million workers who earn  
the current minimum wage of 6,406.79 francs ($1,099) a month -- 
equivalent to 37.91 ($6.50) an hour. The minimum wage, which is 
reviewed annually, was last raised by 2.5 percent in 1996. 
	 Jospin vowed to make employment the ``raison d'etre for all  
government actions'' and said he hoped to produce results by the 
autumn. His party pledged during the campaign to find 700,000 
youth jobs, half of them in the public sector. 
	 He also said he would launch a shift to a 35-hour-week over  
five years in consultation with employers and trade unions, with 
a national conference on wages, jobs and working time to discuss 
the conditions in September. Legislation would also limit the 
abusive recourse to overtime and encourage part-time employment. 
	 In addition, he said he would review France's hardline laws  
on immigration and restore the right for anyone born on French 
soil to French citizenship. 
	 ``The legislation on citizenship, foreigners and immigration  
which was made complex and at times incoherent through too many 
successive changes, will be reviewed as a whole,'' he said in 
his first policy statement to the National Assembly. 
	 ``A bill will be tabled during the next parliamentary  
session,'' he said. 
	 Jospin said he would restore the right to French citizenship  
for anyone born in France, which had been partially abolished by 
the previous conservative government as part of tough laws to 
curb immigration. 
	 Jospin said his leftwing government would keep fighting  
illegal immigration and clandestine labor but would look into 
``intolerable'' individual situations. 
	 Keeping an election campaign promise, he has already  
appointed a mediator to oversee a case-by-case review of tens of 
thousands of illegal immigrants and grant permits to those 
fulfilling at least one of six criteria set by the National 
Consultative Council on Human Rights, a civil rights watchdog. 
	 Those who will get residency include parents of children  
born in France, spouses of immigrants with legal status, those 
in danger if sent home, patients receiving intensive medical 
care, students and immigrants ``well-integrated in French 
society.'' 
	 The move could affect 20,000 to 40,000. A spokesman for the  
protesters said it could affect 100,000. 
	 Former interior minister Jean-Louis Debre, a leader of the  
Gaullist RPR party of President Jacques Chirac, has predicted 
the plan would attract more foreigners to France and bolster the 
extreme right. 
	 Jospin also pledged to shield the justice system from  
political meddling by protecting investigating judges from 
government interference. 
	 ``I announce solemnly that from today, no instructions will  
be given by the justice minister that might affect the pursuit 
of an individual investigation,'' he said in a keynote policy 
address to the National Assembly.
