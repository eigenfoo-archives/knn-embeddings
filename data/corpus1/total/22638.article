from North, South and Central America met in Panama Wednesday to 
discuss women's rights, the eradication of child labor and other 
social issues. 
	 U.S. first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton arrived in Panama  
City late Wednesday to join over 20 first ladies in the two-day 
annual meeting. She is scheduled to make a speech to the 
conference Thursday on the importance of women participating 
fully in the democratic process in the region. 
	 She said on arrival in Panama City she looked forward to  
discussing progress made and challenges ahead in advancing the 
health and education of all people, particularly women and 
children. 
	 ``In the next two days we will ... adopt new commitments on  
education for human rights and the eradication of child labor,'' 
Panama's first lady Dora Boyd de Perez Balladares told the 
opening session. 
	 Chile's first lady Marta Larraechea de Freid said it gave  
her ``so much joy that these projects (of helping women and 
children) that began timidly and slowly are now with so much 
force''. 
	 The seventh Conference of First Ladies of the Americas, also  
attended by representatives from U.N. agencies, the World Bank 
and the Inter-American Development Bank, will focus on projects 
in Latin America to help children and women. 
	 Queen Fabiola of Belgium, invited to bring a European  
perspective, said ``time has come to fully recognize the dignity 
of women, to acknowledge their essential role in society, and to 
denounce poverty and discrimination as the starkest denials of 
their basic human rights''. 
	 The U.S. first lady Thursday will attend a signing ceremony  
for a $4.5 million U.S. grant to the Inter-American Institute on 
Human Rights, a Latin American group that promotes human rights 
and democracy in the region. 
	 Her aides said she would stress the importance of women  
receiving legal protection, property rights and protection from 
domestic violence to participate fully in civil society. 
	 On Friday, she will tour the Panama Canal by helicopter and  
visit a rural reforestation project partly funded by the United 
States. 
	 She returns to Washington Friday afternoon and then leaves  
again on Sunday with her husband, President Clinton, for a tour 
of South America, visiting Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
