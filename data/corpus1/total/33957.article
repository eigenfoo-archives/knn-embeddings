halted their efforts late Tuesday to recover the bodies of 53 
victims of a plane crash, after finding nearly 70 percent of the 
passengers among debris strewn across four kilometers (2.5 miles) of 
mountain jungle. 
   The rescue teams, comprising some 300 people from the army,  
police, Red Cross and firefighters, suspended their efforts at 4:30 
p.m. (2130 GMT), more than 10 hours after they began. 
   "It's a tragic scene: human remains are lying amid the  
vegetation and twisted pieces of fuselage are scattered everywhere. 
Luggage, clothing and all kinds of debris are spread through a 
radius of more than four kilometers," said Major Javier Rivera, head 
of the government firefighting unit. 
   Air France Flight 422, a three-engine Boeing 727-200 chartered  
by the French airline to cover the last leg of its 
Paris-Bogota-Quito route, crashed Monday with no survivors. There 
were 43 passengers and a crew of 10 on board. 
   The plane, owned by Ecuador's TAME airline, slammed into the  
ground about 50 meters (165 feet) below the peak of the 3,444-meter 
(10,500-foot) El Cable mountain. The fuel tanks exploded and 
engulfed the wreckage in flames. 
   Rescue workers on Tuesday filled 50 large black plastic sacks  
with human remains, carrying them down the mountain to a nearby 
police station where the process of identifying the bodies will 
begin. 
   Because not a single body was intact, forensic science officials  
warned that identification will be slow and difficult. Only after 
the remains have been conclusively tagged will they be surrendered 
to their families. 
   Army and police forces tightly controlled access to the site to  
bar looters, who late Monday had combed the wreckage for valuables. 
   The robbers beat rescuers to the crash site, coming down the  
mountain laden with jewels, watches, wallets, toys and cameras as 
emergency workers made their way up. 
   A 14-year-old boy from the capital's shantytowns who tried to  
get a look at the fuselage Monday fell down a gully and later died 
of exposure, a rescue worker said. The boy's body was found early 
Tuesday. 
   The flight data and cockpit voice recorders -- the aircraft's  
"black box" -- were shipped to Washington where they will be 
examined by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in 
Washington. Because the plane was a US-made Boeing, the NTSB will 
also be involved in the crash probe. 
   Pilot error and poor visibility over Bogota Monday were the most  
likely culprits, according to investigators probing the crash. 
   Authorities ruled out terrorism as a cause of the crash.  
   While the investigation is under the jurisdiction of the  
Colombian government, Air France specialists and French government 
experts were to join the investigation along with TAME officials and 
technicians. 
   TAME maintained the craft was in good mechanical order and the  
crew were competent, while an Air France official in Colombia told 
AFP that the French airline regularly put TAME planes through strict 
mechanical checks. 
   Bogota's civil aviation authority chief Julio Gonzalez said the  
pilot of Flight 422 shifted the trajectory slightly after takeoff. 
   The control tower at El Dorado Airport warned him he was off  
course, and the pilot replied the mistake would be corrected, 
Gonzalez said. 
   When the plane veered to the right, radio contact was lost and  
the plane slammed into one of the many mountains that surround 
Bogota, Gonzalez said. 
   An Air France official here said 38 of the 43 passengers were  
Europeans. 
   The military attache to Ecuador's embassy in Paris, Oscar  
Gallardo, lost his wife and three teenage children in the crash. 
   French President Jacques Chirac Tuesday sent messages of  
condolences to his counterparts in Colombia and Ecuador. 
   "I would like, in the name of the French people, and in my own  
name, to offer you, and the families of the Colombian victims, my 
very sincere condolences and my sympathy," Chirac told Colombian 
President Ernesto Samper. 
   In a message to Ecuador's Fabian Alarcon, Chirac offered his  
"sincere condolences and his heartfelt sympathy for the families of 
all Ecuadoran victims."
