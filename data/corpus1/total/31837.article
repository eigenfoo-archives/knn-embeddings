Albanians demonstrated Friday against recent police violence as 
their leaders boycotted talks with the Serbian government for 
the second day. 
	 The demonstrators gathered on a hill overlooking the center  
of the provincial capital Pristina, carrying signs saying ``Stop 
the massacres,'' ``Stop ethnic cleansing'' and ``We are not 
terrorists.'' 
	 They dispersed after less than an hour, and no incidents  
were reported. Police kept a low profile during the protest, 
close to the U.S. cultural center in the city. 
	 The protest, organized by students and trade unions, was the  
second mass rally in four days against a police crackdown last 
week in which at least 80 people died. The government said the 
action was aimed at separatist guerrillas, but Albanian leaders 
said the victims included women and children. 
	 The organizers demanded an immediate halt to the violence,  
punishment for those responsible, the demilitarization of Kosovo 
and the right of its people to freely express their wish for 
self-determination. 
	 Ibrahim Rugova, the leader of the main ethnic Albanian  
party, the LDK, said Friday the police operation was still going 
on in mountain villages west of Pristina. 
	 ``Besides the villages where the massacres have taken place,  
some other villages continue under siege, including Lausa and 
Broja and some others,'' he told reporters. 
	 However a Reuters correspondent who visited Lausa, some 25  
miles from Pristina, saw no evidence Friday of continued 
fighting. People were returning to their homes after hiding in 
hills for several days, though they claimed there were snipers 
on a ridge overlooking the village. 
	 Shortly before the demonstration in Pristina, Rugova and  
other Albanian political leaders boycotted talks with Serbian 
government negotiators for a second day. 
	 After passing up the first meeting Thursday, they accused  
Belgrade of giving them no warning and setting preconditions 
which ruled out the option of full independence. 
	 Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Ratko Markovic and his team  
waited in vain Friday for the leaders to turn up in response to 
personal invitations. 
	 He said later there were objections that the Belgrade team  
did not represent the Yugoslav federal government. 
	 ``The Serbian government's position is that Kosovo is part  
of Serbia and is Serbia's internal affair ... The government of 
Serbia remains fully open for discussion at any time and place 
in the territory of Serbia,'' he added before returning with his 
team to Belgrade. 
	 Both sides are maneuvering for diplomatic and political  
advantage with one eye on the West, which is sympathetic to the 
Albanians but rejects independence as a solution. 
	 A U.S. State Department spokesman accused Belgrade of  
conducting a ``propaganda exercise'' by proposing talks under 
conditions which the Albanians were bound to reject. 
	 His remarks angered the Serbian delegation, one of whose  
members said: ``This only encourages the Albanians to shy away 
from dialogue.'' 
	 Western countries led by the United States have given  
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic two weeks to start talks 
with the Kosovo Albanians or risk tightened sanctions. 
	 State Department spokesman James Rubin has said Deputy  
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott would visit Balkan countries 
next week to discuss efforts they could make to confront 
Milosevic's ``unacceptable actions in Kosovo.'' 
	 One American idea is to beef up the U.N. peacekeeping force  
of 700 U.S. and Scandinavian troops in neighboring Macedonia to 
prevent Kosovo's conflict spreading beyond Serbian borders, 
Rubin said.
