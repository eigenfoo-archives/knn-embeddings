motor was reforged in a left-of-centre mould on Tuesday as France 
and Germany agreed on plans for EU-wide action on jobs and taxes as 
well as closer scrutiny of stock speculators. 
   The proposals were sketched in a communique here in the runup to  
an EU summit this month, which will be followed on January 1 with 
the birth of the euro, the cornerstone achievement of Franco-German 
cooperation. 
   The leaders of the two countries agreed to push for:  
   - a "pact for European job creation," a French-inspired scheme  
which would require EU members to "attain binding and verifiable 
goals" in reducing youth unemployment, long-term joblessness and job 
discrimination against women. 
   - negotiations at EU level between trade unions and business  
chiefs to achieve "significant advances" in such areas as working 
hours, job training, pay raises and working conditions. 
   - stronger surveillance of financial markets, including  
speculative funds and tax havens. 
   - "rapid progress in fiscal harmonisation" among the 15-member  
EU. 
   The two-day summit gathered, at the top level, French President  
Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin as well as 
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany. 
   Reflecting the now close ties between the two former enemy  
countries, there were also meetings among around 30 ministers, 
ranging from economy and finance to youth affairs. 
   Analysts said the communique statement -- which did not spell  
out key details -- reflected the leftwing instincts of the 
governments now in power in Paris and Bonn, after years in which a 
conservative approach prevailed in those capitals. 
   Jospin is a Socialist and Schroeder is a Social Democrat who  
took office after general elections on September 27. 
   Under former chancellor Helmut Kohl and president Francois  
Mitterrand, the alliance pushed ahead on grand European schemes, 
especially the EU's single currency project. 
   But it also avoided imposing interventionist policies at EU  
level in such areas as tax harmonisation, binding commitments on job 
creation and intrusive surveillance in tax havens. 
   These approaches are anathema to Britain, which opposes EU  
control over key national economic levers -- particularly any move 
that would threaten the City of London financial hub and the British 
tax havens of the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey. 
   Only hours before the summit communique, British Chancellor of  
the Exchequer Gordon Brown derided as "scare stories" press reports 
that France and Germany were planning to standardise value added 
tax, corporation and income tax. 
   He gave notice that Britain would oppose any tax harmonisation  
across the EU, particularly a withholding tax on savings. 
   "Tax harmonisation is not the way forward. Business throughout  
Europe does not want it. I believe there is increasing support for 
our position," he said. 
   Brown -- who went to Brussels for a meeting of EU finance and  
economy ministers -- argued for fair tax competition in the EU, 
achieved by eliminating fiscal discrimination. 
   The tax debate has intensified just four weeks from the launch  
of the euro, at the start of Germany's six-month presidency of the 
EU, a term that Schroeder on Tuesday declared would be a "new start, 
with new methods, new ideas." 
   Germany wants to shut the door to the risk of capital flight  
from high-tax countries to economies that have low taxes. Britain 
says lower taxes should be encouraged as a means to promote economic 
growth. 
   The summit communique said the two countries were determined to  
reach "overall agreement" on Agenda 2000, a plan whose chief goal is 
to overhaul the EU's finances and the funding of the Common 
Agricultural Policy and the enlargement of the Union. 
   Germany signalled it was easing its demands for a reduction in  
its contribution to the EU budget, with Schroeder saying his 
government would "go easy on its partners." 
   France and Germany regularly hold meetings at  
heads-of-government level, and always before EU summits, when they 
seek to find a common ground on big issues. 
   The next EU summit takes place in Vienna, under Austrian  
presidency, on December 11-12.
