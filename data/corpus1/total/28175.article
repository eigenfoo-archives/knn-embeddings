weekend earthquake are begining to suffer from flu and diarrhea as 
they brave freezing temperatures, unable to use their homes for fear 
of aftershocks. 
   Many of the elderly and young are suffering from flu and  
diarrhea, according to the head of one of the 17 medical teams in 
the area, and 140 people were treated Monday, the Xinhua news agency 
said. 
   Two days after Saturday's temblor -- which killed 47 and left  
some 44,000 homeless in rural villages 220 kilometres (136 miles) 
northwest of here in Hebei province -- officials continued to warn 
of follow-on quakes. 
   "An aftershock of an intensity between four and five degrees is  
still possible, as is often the case after a major earthquake," a 
State Seismology Bureau official told AFP, assuring the capital was 
out of danger. 
   Villagers in the quake zone have been ordered to stay out of  
their homes for up to one week -- forcing them to adopt emergency 
measures to survive the coldest winter weather of the year. 
   The temperature on Monday lingered at minus 10 degrees Celsius  
(four degrees Fahrenheit) but has been falling as low as minus 20 
degrees Celsius (minus four Fahrenheit) at night. 
   "Sunday at noon, local officials came to tell us that we could  
not return to our place within six or seven days," a 37-year-old 
farmer surnamed Yin said by telephone from Hailiutu county, 20 
kilometres (12 miles) north of the epicentre. 
   Another survivor, Cao Guimei, said residents of her village,  
Dayintan, were afraid to sleep indoors and had spent nights without 
sleep around a bonfire. 
   "I don't know how long this can last. We will listen to the  
radio and wait for information before returning to our homes," the 
45-year-old teacher said. 
   In the township of Dongyingpan, around 30 kilometres (20 miles)  
from the worst-hit area, peasants forced by the cold to seek refuge 
in their damaged homes have set up home-made alarm systems to alert 
them of aftershocks. 
   "We have balanced beer bottles upside-down and hung bells on  
string to wake us up in case of new tremors," Zhang Sheng told AFP, 
adding most were staying outside as late as possible, only going 
inside to sleep at 3:00 or 4:00 a.m. 
   Local officials in Zhangjiakou prefecture -- which covers the  
three counties in Hebei that suffered the heaviest losses -- told 
AFP early Monday they had received assurances further aftershocks 
would likely be no higher than 4.5 on the Richter scale. 
   Xinhua quoted an officer in the area, Zhao Weili, as saying they  
had put up over 400 tents in the area, enough to temporarily house 
6,000 or so homeless villagers. 
   More than 300 separate tremors have been recorded since  
Saturday's temblor, which measured 6.2, the State Seismology Bureau 
said. 
   The Zhangjiakou officials said more than seven million yuan  
(around 850,000 dollars) of commodities had been distributed to 
quake victims, not including food. 
   These include more than 20,000 cotton overcoats and quilts as  
well as 1,500 tents, which were distributed by thousands of soldiers 
dispatched to the area. 
   Despite the cold, there had been no outbreaks of illness, the  
official said. 
   The official Xinhua news agency carried numerous reports of  
donations by various local governments and state organisations. 
   Over two million yuan poured in from areas outside of Hebei, it  
said. 
   So far, Pakistan and Hong Kong have indicated they will provide  
aid to the quake victims. 
   Hong Kong's Red Cross Society pledged one million yuan in aid  
immediately after Saturday's temblor and has already sent a working 
group to the area, Xinhua reported. 
   Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa said Monday the  
territory's government was "closely working" with the Red Cross here 
and in China to ascertain what kind of assistance was needed and 
would make "a decision very soon," on what official aid to send. 
   A front-page article in the official China Daily provided a  
glimpse at a village that lost all 500 of its homes. 
   "It took me 7,000 yuan to build the three-room house and it was  
just completed last year," farmer Wang Faping was quoted as saying 
of his former home in Mijiagou village. 
   He said he also lost his 42-year-old father-in-law in the  
disaster. 
   "I was about to eat my lunch when suddenly there was a lound  
rumbling noise and the house began to shatter," he said. 
   "I called out to my wife and my father-in-law to run. My wife  
escaped with scratches on her legs, but my father-in-law wasn't so 
lucky," he added. 
   Police have sealed off such severely affected villages to the  
foreign media.
