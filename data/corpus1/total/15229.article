urging residents to remain vigilant even though the overflowing Red 
River is starting to recede after reaching record high levels. 
	Fargo operations director Dennis Walaker told the Minneapolis Star  
Tribune Sunday that residents still must carefully monitor the sandbag 
dikes and levees that have held back most of the floodwaters. 
	The river crested Saturday at 37.6 feet, 20 feet above flood stage.  
That breaks the record of 37.3 feet set in 1969. 
	The National Weather Service says minor fluctuations are likely over  
the next few days along the river, but Walaker says a second crest is 
not likely unless the area gets hit with more heavy snow this week. 
	Forecasters are calling for warmer temperatures in the 50s on Monday,  
which should speed runoff from melting snow. But overnight lows in the 
20s are expected to slow the pace somewhat. 
	The crest, meanwhile, is headed downstream along the north-flowing  
river and is expected to reach Grand Forks, 75 miles away, in 6 to 9 
days. 
	Residents in Grand Forks have already built up the city's dikes to 52  
feet, 3 feet higher than the predicted crest. Grand Forks County 
emergency management director Jim Campbell says his town is ready, but 
people will be on high alert until the Red begins its fall. 
	He tells the newspaper, ``We're going to be watching it all very  
closely.''
