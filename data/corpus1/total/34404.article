prayed Wednesday at the funeral for a Roman Catholic bishop 
whose brutal killing shocked a nation that thought it had 
overcome its violent past. 
	 Juan Jose Gerardi, 75, was found Monday with his head  
crushed by a cement block, the victim of an apparent political 
assassination. A longtime campaigner for human rights, he was 
murdered two days after presenting a report on civil war 
atrocities. 
	 ``His truth wounded those who live only for lies and  
trickery ... and that is why they killed him,'' Bishop Gerardo 
Flores from a rural area of northern Guatemala told mourners who 
packed the Guatemala City cathedral. 
	 The cathedral was so crowded that hundreds of people spilled  
onto the steps outside where they listened to the Mass on 
loudspeakers. 
	 Mourners bearing wreaths were unable to reach the front and  
had to pass flowers overhead so they could be set near the 
casket. The service was also broadcast live on national radio. 
	 More than 351 priests 20 bishops, including visiting church  
officials from El Salvador, Honduras, Panama and the United 
States, participated in the Mass. 
	 After the funeral Gerardi's body was carried slowly around  
the capital's main plaza and then was to be buried in a crypt in 
the back of the cathedral. 
	 Gerardi was killed by an unknown attacker as he got out of  
his car at home. He had headed a three-year study titled ``Never 
Again'' about atrocities during Guatemala's 36-year civil war. 
	 The war was a dirty conflict in which tens of thousands of  
civilians were killed or ``disappeared,'' including Indian 
peasants, intellectuals, labor leaders, opposition politicians, 
journalists and priests. It ended with a peace treaty between 
the government and leftist rebels in 1996. 
	 Gerardi's Historical Memory Recovery project was the first  
attempt to document completely who killed whom during years of 
violence. 
	 Human rights and church leaders said Gerardi was killed  
because of the contents of the report, which blamed the army for 
the vast majority of massacres, assassinations, tortures and 
disappearances during the war. 
	 The study, a collection of thousands of testimonials by war  
survivors, also charged guerrilla forces with killing civilians 
during the war. 
	 ``We cannot rule out that this was an act of vengeance  
against Monsignor Gerardi for his work on the Historical Memory 
Recovery project,'' said Jean Arnault, chief of the United 
Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala,  Tuesday. 
	 During his homily, Bishop Flores evoked the name of  
Gerardi's report, shouting ``Guatemala, never again.'' The crowd 
responded with 90 seconds of applause and a man standing near 
Gerardi's open casket began sobbing loudly. 
	 Gerardi, a Guatemalan-born man of Italian descent, spoke out  
for human rights and took risks during his years in the church. 
	 Friends said he received death threats in the 1970s and  
1980s. When he was bishop of the northern province of Quiche, 
several priests under him were assassinated and from 1982 to 
1984 he lived in exile. 
	 His slaying has embarrassed Guatamelans. Just three weeks  
ago the country was taken off the United Nations' so-called 
''black list'' of nations that need monitoring for human rights 
abuses after 19 years. Many Guatemalans have only recently 
become to feel they could speak out without being killed for 
their ideas.
