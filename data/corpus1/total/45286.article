killing eight people and injuring about two dozen others Monday, 
just a week after the building failed a safety inspection, 
officials said. 
	About 140 firefighters fought the pre-dawn blaze in Livry-Gargan  
in the northern working-class suburb of Seine-Saint-Denis. 
Officials said it began in a ground-floor room and spread up the 
elevator shaft over three floors. 
	The head of the rescue service, Commander Jean-Luc Chivot,  
estimated that the fire had been burning for half an hour before 
rescue workers were alerted. 
	He said about 40 of the approximately 80 people in the home were  
evacuated by ladder. 
	``We were able to get them out fast,'' he said. ``Otherwise, the  
death toll would have been higher.'' 
	Chivot said the retirement home failed to pass a Dec. 1  
inspection. Among other things, the safety commission found that 
emergency facilities to help rescue workers in the event of a 
disaster were insufficient, Chivot said on France-3 television. 
	According to the all-news television station LCI, the fire may  
have been started by a short circuit in an electric bed. 
	In a northern Paris neighborhood, another fire left three people  
dead and 13 injured, three seriously, firefighters said. 
	That blaze in the 9th district near Montmartre also broke out  
before dawn, and 150 firefighters took an hour to put it out. 
	Causes of both blazes were under investigation.
