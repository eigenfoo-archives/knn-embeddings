Russia's entire government on Monday in a shock announcement but 
said reforms would stay on track. 
	 ``The dismissal of the government does not mean a change of  
course in our policy. It is an effort to make economic reforms 
more energetic and effective, to give them a political push, a 
new impulse,'' Yeltsin, 67, said in a television address. 
	 The Kremlin also said foreign policy would not be altered.  
	 Yeltsin said initially he would take over temporarily as  
prime minister from pro-reform Viktor Chernomyrdin, but later 
signed a decree appointing young Fuel and Energy Minister Sergei 
Kiriyenko as his acting premier. 
	 The moves seemed to open up Russia's presidential race.  
Chernomyrdin has been widely seen as Yeltsin's chosen successor 
but has now had his main power base removed two years before the 
election. He was given the job of organizing next year's 
parliamentary election and the presidential vote the year after. 
	 Yeltsin said the government had failed to carry out some key  
tasks and many ordinary Russians had not felt the benefits of 
more than five years of market reforms. 
	 ``The current cabinet team ... unfortunately could not cope  
with a number of key questions,'' Yeltsin said. ``Many people do 
not feel the changes for the better.'' 
	 Millions of workers in the state sector have not been paid  
for months and have endured hardships under the reforms. Yeltsin 
has increasingly expressed disappointment with the results of 
the reforms in the last few months. 
	 Russian shares opened on average more than three percent  
lower than Friday's close but traders said the market had later 
been cheered by the nomination of Kiriyenko, a reform-minded 
technocrat who has been in the government since November. 
	 In an immediate response to Yeltsin's move, Russia postponed  
the issue of a eurobond denominated in German marks, which was 
to have been its first international borrowing on capital market 
this year. 
	 Yeltsin's announcement heralded his return to the Kremlin  
after a week's absence with a respiratory infection. 
Presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said Yeltsin's 
health was ``superb.'' 
	 The president, who had heart surgery in 1996 and often has  
long spells away, had returned to the Kremlin for three hours on 
Friday but the government's removal was clearly intended to 
reassert his authority. 
	 The dismissal of the whole government is a formality when a  
prime minister is removed and some ministers are likely to keep 
their posts when the new line-up is announced. Technically, 
Chernomyrdin resigned but there was little doubt he was pushed. 
	 One minister who looks set to leave the government is  
economic reform chief Anatoly Chubais. He was removed under a 
separate decree, although he said later he had an agreement with 
Yeltsin to stay in his team in an unspecified role. 
	 The fate of the other chief government reformer, First  
Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov, was less clear but he has 
said he has an agreement with Yeltsin to stay in the government 
for at least another year. 
	 Yeltsin said Chernomyrdin's removal would clear the way for  
his long-term ally to concentrate on the presidential election 
due in the year 2000 but did not say in what capacity. 
	 Chernomyrdin, who stuck stubbornly to reforms in five years  
as prime minister, told a news conference he would do 
preparatory work for the elections. 
	 He is likely to make the most of his role as head of the  
centrist political bloc Our Home is Russia. But he said it was 
premature to say if he would run for president. 
	 Although Chernomyrdin can now concentrate on the elections,  
he has lost his main power-base and could struggle to stay in 
the public eye, denting his chances of election, analysts said. 
	 They said Yeltsin, who likes to balance rival politicians  
against each other, may have been irked by the independence and 
power Chernomyrdin had mustered because Yeltsin appeared to be 
grooming him as his chosen successor. 
	 Chernomyrdin and Yeltsin described the government's  
replacement as a ``natural process'' that would not affect 
reform. 
	 ``It is not a catastrophe. There is no government crisis in  
the country,'' Chernomyrdin told the news conference. ``I 
particularly appeal to the entrepreneurial sector, to our 
Russian bankers. There's no need for panic.''
