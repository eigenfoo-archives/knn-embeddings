before the start of the upcoming NATO summit in Madrid by 
touring a 14th Century circular castle that he marvelled was 
``really wonderful.'' 
	 King Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofia led the president and his  
wife Hillary on a leisurely tour of the stone castle that was 
erected by James II, king of Majorca and later used in the 18th 
Century as a prison for captured French soldiers. 
	 ``I've never seen anything like this before...beautiful  
architecture,'' said Clinton as he stood at the center of its 
huge circular courtyard. 
	 ``It's really wonderful,'' he told reporters nearby.  
	 When one journalist jokingly observed that the scenic  
setting was a nice place to keep prisoners, Clinton smiled and 
said, ``It almost makes you want to go to jail out here.'' 
	 After the tour, the King and Queen escorted the Clintons to  
Almudaina Palace, a 10th Century Moorish castle that will serve 
as their home on the famous resort island off Spain's southern 
coast. 
	 The Clintons arrived on Majorca in mid-afternoon after  
departing Washington around midnight so they could watch the 
traditional Fourth of July Independence Day fireworks display in 
the U.S. capitol. 
	 The Clintons plan to join the King for an outing on his  
yacht Sunday. They will remain in Majorca until Monday, when 
Clinton flies to Madrid for brief talks with Prime Minister Jose 
Maria Aznar and a dinner with the other 15 leaders attending the 
NATO summit. 
	 The two-day summit is expected to end with the alliance  
extending invitations to join NATO to Poland, Hungary and the 
Czech Republic. Clinton blunted efforts to extend membership to 
other countries, particularly Romania and Slovinia. 
	 Mindful of objections growing in the U.S. Congress to  
increasing American military obligations abroad -- along with 
the added financial commitments that go with it -- Clinton 
insisted that no more than three nations be admitted this time. 
	 In a gesture designed to soften the disappointment of other  
countries not asked to join NATO, Clinton will fly to Romania on 
Friday to show his willingness to add new members at a later 
date. Thursday he visits Poland. 
	 Clinton already has begun campaigning in the United States  
for increasing NATO by three nations. He argues that the 
benefits of increased security and stability in Europe is worth 
the $200 million a year cost for a decade to U.S. taxpayers. 
	 He also contends that the move in the long run will reduce  
the chances that Americans will be drawn into fighting another 
war in Europe, as they have twice this century. 
	 Clinton concludes his trip with a state visit to Denmark,  
before returning to Washington on July 12.
