killed and more than 100 injured, including one American, in a 
grenade attack on a demonstration led by opposition leader and 
apparent target Sam Rainsy in the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh 
Sunday. 
	 Police said four grenades ripped through the crowd of  
150-200 demonstrators outside the Cambodian National Assembly 
around 8:30 a.m. (8:30 p.m. EST) during a protest against the 
judiciary. 
	 Sam Rainsy, leader of the officially unrecognized Khmer  
Nation Party (KNP), narrowly escaped injury in the attack and 
accused co-Prime Minister Hun Sen of being behind it. 
	 The attack killed at least 12 people, a municipal policeman  
said by phone, adding that seven were killed on the scene and 
five died in hospitals. 
	 Sam Rainsy's wife Tioulong Saumura put the death toll at 15  
and said 120 people had been wounded. Doctors at three major 
hospitals said eight people had been brought in dead or had died 
after arrival and more than 100 injured. 
	 American Ron Abney, 55, of Cochran, Ga., who works for  
International Republican Institute was wounded in the thigh by 
shrapnel, and the Xinhua (New China News Agency) reporter, Zhu 
Changdu, was taken to the hospital with a serious stomach wound. 
	 Sam Rainsy, in a blood-smeared shirt and jacket, said his  
bodyguard Han Mony and KNP steering committee member Chhet 
Daravuth were among the dead and added that journalists had 
taken much of the blast as they stood between him and the 
grenades. 
	 Fired from his position as finance minister in late 1994 for  
his criticism of the government and expelled from parliament a 
year later, Sam Rainsy pledged to continue struggling for 
democracy and human rights.
