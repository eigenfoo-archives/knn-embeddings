political obstacles confront plans to airlift home 100,000 
Rwandan Hutu refugees from rebel-held eastern Zaire. 
	 News that the international community will pay to fly the  
refugees back began percolating Sunday through the squalid 
makeshift camps in the jungle south of Kisangani where the Hutus 
are surviving thanks to relief food, water and medicine. 
	 ``Most of us have heard about this on the radio. It is very  
good because if we stay here surely everyone will die,'' Tenace 
Kabera, a refugee, said at Kasese, 15 miles south of Kisangani 
where 50,000 Hutus are camped. 
	 ``With the equipment we have we can start this week,'' Paul  
Stromberg, spokesman of the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR said. 
	 ``But for big numbers we need larger planes which we are  
trying to get now,'' he said in rebel-held Kisangani. 
	 But key issues need to be resolved. Rwanda has yet to  
confirm that it will accept planes flying the refugees straight 
back to the capital, Kigali and the Rwandan-backed rebels now 
controlling over a third of Zaire also have their concerns about 
the repatriation. 
	 The airlift will also have to overcome the decrepit  
condition of most of the airports in the area, which fail to 
meet any normal standards of safety and maintenance. 
	 Saturday, after 48 hours of high-level and very public  
pressure, the U.N. extracted an agreement from rebel leader 
Laurent Kabila to allow the refugees to be flown home. 
	 He had preferred the road option despite evidence that parts  
of the 300 mile route are impassable to vehicles, particularly 
in the rainy season. 
	 Kisangani was soaked by a tropical deluge Sunday.  
	 Rwandan authorities will want to closely screen the  
returnees, the rump of more than two million Hutus who fled into 
exile in 1994. Many of them joined the former army and 
Interahamwe militia in committing the genocide of some 800,000 
minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus which began exactly three 
years ago. 
	 ``In this case there will be more severe screening before  
they can go back to their homes,'' Aldo Aiello, the European 
Union special envoy for the region, said Saturday. 
	 ``People who are responsible for crimes will have to (answer  
for) them,'' he said. 
	 Rwanda is already detaining about 100,000 Hutus in prison.  
	 During a weekend interview, Roberto Garreton, the United  
Nations human rights investigaor accused Tutsi-led rebels in the 
east of continuing to massacre civilians and Rwandan Hutu 
refugees. 
	 Garreton, who has been the U.N. human rights investigator  
for Zaire since 1994, told Reuters he was demanding a full U.N. 
investigation into the killings and mass graves with the help of 
forensic scientists and experts. 
	 He said he had eyewitness accounts of many killings by the  
rebels long after their military victories late last year. 
	 ``In parts of east Zaire, the war is finished. But massacres  
by the rebels are continuing,'' Garreton said. 
	 ``I have a list of massacres committed by the rebels. In  
March, there were still people disappearing, people being 
arrested and new massacres,'' he said following a brief visit to 
the rebel-controlled border town of Goma last week. 
	 Garreton said he would give details of new abuses alleged to  
have been committed by the rebels in February and March in his 
report to the annual U.N. Human Rights Commission meeting in 
Geneva. 
	 Most of the victims were Rwandan Hutus. The dead also  
included local Zairians, he said. 
	 The rebels want the refugees kept in the bush along a rail  
track south of Kisangani and brought up in batches by truck and 
by ferry across the mighty Zaire river -- now renamed the Congo 
river -- to Kisangani's two airports. 
	 The rebels also want a payback by obtaining the same aerial  
repatriation for internally displaced Zairians, who were forced 
out of their towns and villages further east by the fighting. 
	 The United Nations and some world capitals have fought hard  
to defend the interests of the refugees, who are dying at the 
rate of about 120 a day, according to the UNHCR. 
	 Aid workers said they buried 66 refugees Saturday at the two  
main sites where 80,000 refugees are squatting. 
	 Sunday a weeping mother carried her dead four-year-old in  
her arms to the burial site. 
	 ``I want to go back, even if it's today,'' she wailed.  
	 ``I'm hungry, I'm sick and my children are dying.''  
	 Zaire peace negotiations got under way Sunday at a secret  
location somewhere in South Africa but analysts said it was 
difficult to see how the two sides could achieve a compromise 
that would permit a cease-fire in the six-month-old civil war. 
	 In an apparent bid for conciliation, Zaire's President  
Mobutu Sese Seko told a South African Sunday newspaper that 
rebel leader Kabila was a ``nationalist patriot'' and urged him 
to make peace for the good of the country.
