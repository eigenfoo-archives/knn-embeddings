Friday ruled out an Israeli pullback from more of the West Bank 
until the Palestinian Authority took firm action to fight 
``terror.'' 
	 In an interview with Reuters, he said the two issues were  
``intimately coupled'' and that Israel would not bow to outside 
pressure to move ahead with a withdrawal. 
	 He said it was not certain that a plan detailing the extent  
of any withdrawal would be ready in time for an expected meeting 
next month with U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
	 ``Agreements aren't that Israel keeps its obligations. It's  
Israel keeps its obligations provided the Palestinians keep 
theirs,'' Netanyahu said. 
	 He said he was insisting on a ``minimum period of a few  
months'' to monitor whether the Palestinians were complying with 
past pledges to combat violence against Israel by Islamic 
militants ``and then Israel moves as well.'' 
	 ``Most of the things that we do, and anything involving  
territory, is finite and irreversible. We give it up. 
	 ``Before we give up the next piece of territory we want to  
see a period of some compliance with those obligations that the 
Palestinians promised to us. This is a minimal demand,'' he 
said. 
	 U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright failed on  
Thursday to bridge gaps between Israeli and Palestinian leaders 
that have contributed to nine months of deadlock in peace talks. 
	 She held what she called ``substantive and intensive'' talks  
with Netanyahu in Paris and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat 
in London, but ``these are complicated issues and gaps remain.'' 
	 ``With that in mind, I am going to recommend to the  
president that he meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu and 
Chairman Arafat separately in Washington in January,'' she said. 
	 U.S. officials said they hoped that by the time of the  
meetings with Clinton, for which no exact dates have been set, 
both leaders would have taken the decisions Washington sought. 
	 Netanyahu's right-wing cabinet has been engaged in weeks of  
acrimonious debate that has failed to set a percentage figure 
for a long-delayed withdrawal of troops from parts of the West 
Bank, captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War. 
	 The debate forms part of a wider cabinet discussion to  
determine the extent of what Netanyahu called ``broad and 
continuous security zones'' Israel would insist on retaining in 
a final peace settlement with the Palestinians. 
	 ``This is not an issue which can be subjected to pressure.  
We are the ones who have to decide what are the defence margins 
of Israel,'' Netanyahu said. 
	 The United States has urged Arafat to improve his record of  
fighting militants from the Hamas and Islamic Jihad movements, 
responsible for attacks in Israel, but has also shown mounting 
impatience with perceived foot dragging by Israel. 
	 Albright has called for a ``significant and credible''  
withdrawal as a prelude to accelerated final peace talks. 
	 Netanyahu said the withdrawal issue had to be balanced at  
his meeting with Clinton by what he said was an American promise 
to ensure Palestinian compliance with security commitments made 
under various accords since the 1993 Oslo interim peace accord. 
	 These included jailing guerrilla leaders, confiscating  
illegal weapons and dismantling organisations in Palestinian 
self-rule areas that fund Islamic militants. 
	 ``We have every right to expect that compliance that has  
been promised to us by the United States and the United States 
understands that,'' he said. 
	 Arafat told reporters on Thursday that Palestinian and U.S.  
officials had agreed on the text of a document on security 
cooperation but said Israel had yet to agree the draft. 
	 Netanyahu has said a detailed plan has yet to be worked out.
