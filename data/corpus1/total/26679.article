Wednesday he would boycott a meeting Thursday between Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright because 
Israel could not present the US diplomat with promised details of an 
overdue troop pullback from the West Bank. 
   Levy said two special cabinet sessions late Tuesday and early  
Wednesday had failed to overcome differences between hardliners and 
moderates over the "parameters" for the troop withdrawal. 
   Albright has made clear that she expects Netanyahu to provide  
concrete information on his government's pullback plans when the two 
meet Thursday morning in Paris. 
   "We must go to Paris with ideas and parameters for reviving the  
peace process," Levy said on Israel radio, explaining his reason for 
remaining home. 
   But Levy added that he could change his mind if Netanyahu  
succeeds in convincing cabinet hardliners to lift their objections 
to detailing Israel's possible troop withdrawal plans to Albright at 
this time. 
   Netanyahu, who was scheduled to leave for Paris later Wednesday,  
was meeting with the leading government hawk, Infrastructure 
Minister Ariel Sharon, to try to reach agreement on what could be 
unveiled to Albright, Levy said. 
   At a stormy three-and-a-half-hour cabinet meeting Tuesday night,  
an angry Sharon told Netanyahu he was "about to cross the line of 
jeopardizing national interests" by favoring an overly generous 
transfer of land to Palestinian rule. 
   The cabinet has been trying to define what parts of the West  
Bank are vital to Israel's security and cannot be ceded to 
Palestinians as part of a permanent peace agreement. 
   Based on this, the government willl determine the scope of a  
troop pullback required by interim peace accords ahead of 
negotiations with the Palestinians on a final peace deal. 
   Albright has demanded a quick and "significant" troop withdrawal  
at this stage, although Netanyahu has insisted the government will 
not be able to determine the exact scope of the pullback before 
mid-January. 
   Then he wants a five-month delay in implementing the withdrawal  
to judge whether the Palestinians are living up to their commitment 
to fight Islamic militants.
