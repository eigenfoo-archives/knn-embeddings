	JERUSALEM, April 17 (UPI) -- Israel Radio Thursday announced that  
former president Chaim Herzog had died of a respiratory ailment at the 
age of 78. 
	The son of a chief rabbi of Israel, Herzog studied law and served in  
the British armed forces during World War II, eventually rising to the 
rank of major general in the Israeli army. He served as Israel's 
president from 1983 until 1993. 
	Israel Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's office issued a statement  
saying: ``We will remember Chaim Herzog with thanks and recognition.'' 
	He said Herzog ``served his nation with honor.''  
	Former prime minister and current opposition leader Shimon Peres  
said: ``Herzog was pehaps the most noble that Israel has ever known by 
his abilities, his personality and his seniority.'' 
	Herzog was born in Ireland on September 18, 1918. His father was the  
distinguished Rabbi Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog. 
	He emigrated to Palestine in 1935, and served in the Haganah during  
the Arab revolt of 1936-38. 
	He acquired a degree in law and served in the British army in World  
War II. As head of intelligence in northern Germany he participated in 
the liberation of the concentration camps. 
	In Israel's War of Independence (1948) he served as an officer in the  
battles for Latrun. 
	Herzog headed the IDF Military Intelligence Branch from 1948-50, and  
again in 1959-62. From 1950-1954 he served as defense attache in 
Washington. He retired from the army in 1962, and engaged in business 
and law. 
	During the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, Herzog was the leading military  
commentator on Israeli radio, and afterwards became the first military 
governor of the West Bank. 
	Herzog served as Israel's ambassador to the United Nations from 1975-  
1978, where he argued against the U.N. resolution equating Zionism with 
racism. 
	He was elected to the Knesset on the Labor ticket in 1981, serving  
until 1983. 
	Herzog was chosen as the sixth president of Israel in 1983 and served  
two terms, until 1993. 
	Last month, Herzog published his autobiography, ``Living History.''  
His other writings include ``Days of Awe'' (1973); ``Judaism, Law and 
Ethics'' (Ed.) (1974); ``The Arab-Israeli Wars'' (1982); ``Israel's 
Finest Hour'' (1967); ``The War of Atonement'' (1975); and ``Heroes of 
Israel'' (1988).
