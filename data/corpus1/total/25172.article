UN arms inspectors after receiving a Russian pledge to help lift 
economic sanctions, but Washington warned the crisis was not over. 
   As Iraq hailed its accord with Russia as a "victory," Washington  
and London stressed that Baghdad had not won any concessions from 
the United Nations. 
   US President Bill Clinton opted to "wait and see" if Baghdad  
would really allow all UN arms inspectors back into Iraq, while 
deciding to step up the US military buildup in the Gulf. 
   An air expeditionary force of about 30 aircraft, including F-16  
and F-15 fighters, was awaiting orders to deploy to the Gulf, 
according to Pentagon officials. 
   The US ambassador to the United Nations said the deal between  
Moscow and Baghdad was a step forward but "not a resolution" of the 
crisis. 
   It would only be resolved once the UN inspectors were given  
complete access to all Iraqi sites, Bill Richardson said, stressing 
that a US spy plane would continue to fly despite Iraq's past 
threats to shoot it down. 
   On the sanctions front, the United States warned that it would  
still use its veto power "if necessary" at the UN Security Council 
to prevent them from being lifted. 
   Under the accord with Russia, Iraq agreed to allow the UN  
Special Commission (UNSCOM) on disarmament to return "in its full 
composition" and to resume its work from Thursday. 
   UNSCOM chief Richard Butler said his inspectors could fly back  
to Baghdad on Friday, after official notification of Iraq's 
decision, and return to work the next day. 
   Baghdad expelled US members of UNSCOM on November 13. Most of  
the remaining UNSCOM staff were pulled out in protest the next day 
and the teams regrouped in Bahrain. 
   Iraq's reversal followed a middle-of-the-night Geneva meeting  
between top diplomats of the five permanent members of the Security 
Council, at which Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov briefed 
his colleagues. 
   He noted the accord had been achieved "without resorting to  
arms." 
   Moscow, Paris and the Arab world have all been opposed to US  
military action against Baghdad, but London sided with Washington in 
taking a robust stand to force Saddam to back down. 
   "The accord calls for Russia to contribute actively and on the  
basis of Iraq's implementation of UN Security Council resolutions to 
a rapid lifting of the sanctions," notably the lifting of an oil 
embargo, an Iraqi statement said. 
   The agreement referred specifically to paragraph 22 of UN  
Security Council resolution 687 and said the embargo should be 
lifted "without any additional conditions" apart from the 
elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. 
   "To that effect, active measures will be taken to increase the  
effectiveness of the work of UNSCOM, while respecting the 
sovereignty and security of Iraq," the official news agency INA 
said. 
   The accord followed Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz's  
visit to Moscow, where he met President Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday. 
   "If (the agreement) succeeds, we look forward to the lifting of  
sanctions against Iraq. But if the United States continues to deny 
our rights then we will have something else to say," Aziz said in 
Cairo on Thursday. 
   He said that "Russia has a clear understanding of the lack of  
balance" in UNSCOM, which Baghdad says is US-dominated. "But we 
received no other promises," Aziz added. 
   Aziz briefed Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Mussa on the latest  
developments then told reporters, "The views of Egypt and Iraq are 
close. Egypt is not opposed to Iraq, although our positions do not 
completely correspond." 
   Mubarak, in an interview with CNN television, said he had sent a  
message to Saddam expressing concern that Iraq implement Security 
Council resolutions "to avoid more violence in the area." 
   Mubarak said he believed the administration of President Bill  
Clinton recognised that "Arab people are not ready (for the use of 
force.)" 
   Baghdad's showdown with the Security Council and the United  
States erupted on October 29, when Saddam ordered the expulsion of 
US inspectors. 
   Iraq charges that the United States has been exploiting UNSCOM  
to prolong sanctions and topple Saddam. Clinton said last week that 
the embargo would stay in place "as long as" Saddam remained in 
power. 
   Baghdad had vowed not to back down unless UNSCOM was  
restructured, but Moscow this week took the lead in efforts to find 
a face-saving formula to head off a US-Iraqi conflict. 
   The permanent Security Council members said an UNSCOM meeting in  
New York on Friday would deal with ways to make its work "more 
effective on the basis of the resolutions of the UN Security 
Council."
