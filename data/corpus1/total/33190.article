Israel went on strike Monday and hundreds took to the streets in 
a peaceful march against Israeli police brutality and 
demolitions of Arab homes. 
	 Witnesses said protesters, including Arab lawmakers, marched  
to the village of Um al-Sahali, where some 20 Bedouins were hurt 
in clashes on Saturday after police tried to stop Arabs from 
rebuilding homes authorities said had been built without 
permits. 
	 ``It appears the government wants to push the Arab sector by  
force into confrontation with the government,'' said Ahmad Tibi, 
a prominent Israeli Arab and an adviser to Palestinian President 
Yasser Arafat. 
	 ``We are steadfast and came to shout that we will not  
relinquish rights and will fight for them in the clearest and 
loudest fashion,'' Tibi said. 
	 Witnesses said protesters carried Palestinian and Islamic  
flags and chanted slogans calling for unity against Israeli 
house demolitions. 
	 Protesters began work to rebuild the three homes Israeli  
authorities tore down last Thursday. 
	 A police spokeswoman said Arabs had triggered Saturday  
night's clashes by raining stones on officers who came to halt 
the reconstruction of the homes. 
	 She said 22 policemen were hurt and 18 Arabs arrested in the  
unrest and that police used teargas and batons to disperse the 
protesters. 
	 Israel's 850,000 Arab citizens complain of social, political  
and economic discrimination in the Jewish state. 
	 ``Twelve thousand Arab homes are threatened with demolition,  
that is why we say it is a policy in Israel to demolish Arab 
homes,'' said Abed Anabtawi, an Israeli Arab leader. 
	 Anabtawi said Arabs had tried to negotiate with the  
government to prevent last week's demolitions, but to no avail. 
	 He called on Israeli Arabs to cancel meetings this week with  
top Israeli government officials who plan to offer greetings for 
the Moslem Eid al-Adha and Christian Easter festivities. 
	 ``We will boycott the ministers of (Prime Minister Benjamin)  
Netanyahu's fascist government. They are not wanted in Arab 
cities and villages,'' Anabtawi said. 
	 Israeli President Ezer Weizman said he planned to visit the  
northern town of Shefar'am, known in Arabic as Shfa'amr, on 
Friday. 
	 ``I expected that something would blow up. I also told the  
prime minister that he must deal much more urgently with the 
Arab issue and advance this issue because it is explosive,'' 
Weizman told Israel Radio.
