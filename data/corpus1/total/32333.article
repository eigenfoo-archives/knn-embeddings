majority voted for a president and parliament Sunday in 
elections expected to reassert their demands for independence 
from Serbia. 
	 The early turnout was heavy in Pristina, the provincial  
capital of Kosovo, where some stations had queues waiting when 
voting started at 7 a.m. local time (0600 GMT). 
	 The elections were dismissed as illegal by Serbian  
authorities and held against the advice of Western countries, 
which support autonomy for Kosovo but not independence. 
	 Election officials reported that in some Pristina districts  
30 percent of registered Albanian voters cast ballots in the 
first two hours of polling. Only minor problems with Serbian 
police were reported across the region. 
	 ``I am casting my vote for Ibrahim Rugova for President and  
for independence from Serbia,'' said Sahit Elshani, a 
48-year-old professor of biology as he marked the first ballot 
at the Ulpiana elementary school in Pristina. 
	 ``Even if I never live a day as a free man my children will.  
We are voting for peaceful change, not for another Balkan war.'' 
	 Ninety percent of Kosovo's 1.8 million people are ethnic  
Albanians. The province enjoyed autonomy between 1974 and 1989, 
a status revoked by then Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic 
who imposed direct, often draconian rule, from Belgrade. 
	 Kosovo's Albanians responded with a boycott of Serbian state  
institutions and erected their own parallel government, schools, 
hospitals and tax system. 
	 The Ulpiana school where Elshani voted is a perfect example  
of the deep divisions within Kosovo. Half the school is run by 
Serbian authorities, in Serbian. The self-styled Republic of 
Kosovo operates the other half in Albanian. 
	 Ethnic Albanians showed their Yugoslav identity cards as  
proof of residency when their names were ticked off voting 
lists, further evidence of Kosovo's confused state of affairs. 
	 Ibrahim Rugova, a Sorbonne educated writer who heads the  
Democratic League of Kosovo, was elected President of the 
self-styled Republic of Kosova in May 1992. Only neighboring 
Albania recognizes it as a sovereign state. 
	 Rugova's was the only name on the presidential ballot.  
	 A weak challenger dropped out of the race and Rugova's main  
political rival, hard-liner Adem Demaci, refused to run, saying 
the situation in Kosovo was too volatile to play politics. 
	 Ethnic Albanian elections have twice been scheduled and  
postponed since 1992 because of unsettled conditions. 
	 Municipalities in the Drenica region of Kosovo about 40 km  
(25 miles) west of Pristina were not voting because they have 
been surrounded by Serb paramilitary forces since March 5. 
	 A Serbian sweep against alleged Albanian terrorists in the  
area killed 80 people, 25 of them women and children, over the 
past three weeks, raising tensions throughout the province. 
	 Kosovo Albanians were also be voting for a parliament  
consisting of 130 members. 
	 Members of parliament are being elected to four-year terms.  
The president will serve five years in office. 
	 The election's 1,300 polling stations were scheduled to  
close at 1800 GMT and some preliminary returns were expected to 
Monday. 
	 ``It could take some time for the final count to come in  
because a large part of our electorate live in rural areas where 
transportation and communications are poor,'' explained Tadej 
Rodiqi, head of the Kosovo election commission. 
	 ``Having in mind the large police presence in Kosovo our job  
is likely to be even more difficult than it might ordinarily be, 
but we are ready to deal with any contingency.'' 
	 A 14-member U.S. congressional delegation that sought to  
observe the Kosovo elections was in neighboring Macedonia after 
failing to get Yugoslav visas. 
	 The Foreign Ministry in Belgrade said the U.S. team had  
ignored customary procedures and had gone ahead without prior 
agreement from the Yugoslav authorities. 
	 In an apparently unrelated development, a U.S. official in  
Pristina said five American aid workers, including one woman, 
had been arrested by Serbian authorities in Kosovo and sentenced 
to 10 days in jail for not registering with police.
