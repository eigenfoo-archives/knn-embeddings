case Tuesday prepared to wrap up their case after fending off a 
strong attack on their scientific evidence by attorneys for 
defendant Timothy McVeigh. 
	 Federal Judge Richard Matsch said after the jury was  
dismissed for the day that the government was expected to rest 
its case sometime Wednesday. 
	 Prosecutors have presented more than 130 witnesses in little  
more than three weeks, racing through their case far more 
quickly than expected. 
	 The defense will then have its chance to call witnesses and  
rebut the government's allegations that McVeigh planned and 
carried out the April 19, 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah 
federal building that killed 168 people. Chief defense attorney 
Stephen Jones is expected to put his first witness on the stand 
Wednesday. 
	 ``The prosecution has done a real good job in presenting  
their testimony and connecting facts,'' said Marsha Kight, whose 
23-year-old daughter died in the bombing. Kight has attended 
many of the court sessions. 
	 McVeigh, 29, has pleaded not guilty and if convicted faces  
the death penalty. 
	 For the past two days jurors have heard testimony about how  
the Federal Bureau of Investigation gathered and tested key 
evidence. 
	 On Monday, Special Agent Steven Burmeister, who is acting  
head of the Chemical Toxicology Unit at the FBI lab, testified 
that traces of explosives were found on the clothes McVeigh wore 
when he was arrested soon after the bombing. 
	 On Tuesday, defense attorneys launched their attack on  
Burmeister, suggesting that key evidence could have been 
contaminated because of sloppy handling and testing methods. 
	 The cross-examination was crucial because the FBI's  
Washington, D.C., laboratory has come under severe criticism in 
a recent Justice Department study that cited deficient 
operations. 
	 McVeigh's attorneys made every effort to exploit the  
agency's documented weaknesses, while the prosecution even 
presented a British explosives expert to back up the FBI's 
conclusions. 
	 Burmeister had testified that explosives residue was also  
found on earplugs McVeigh had in his pocket and some residue was 
embedded on a panel of the Ryder truck allegedly used in the 
bombing. 
	 Burmeister denied a suggestion by defense attorney  
Christopher Tritico that the force of the explosion would have 
destroyed such particles. ``I could definitely find them on that 
particular object,'' Burmeister said. 
	 British explosives expert Linda Jones of the Forensics  
Explosives Laboratory at the Ministry of Defense said as the 
bomb exploded, the sides of the truck started to disintegrate, 
allowing residue to become embedded in the panel. This 
observation was ``totally consistent with the explosion 
occurring inside the box compartment of the Ryder truck.'' 
	 She also testified that ``there was one device. It was in  
the rear compartment of the Ryder truck.'' 
	 Jones told the court she believed the bomb was made of an  
ammonium nitrate type explosive. ``I consider that it contained 
a mid-range detonating velocity high-explosive,'' she said. 
	 Defense attorney Tritico suggested that McVeigh's clothes  
and other evidence on which traces of explosives residue were 
found could have been contaminated during transportation or at 
different sections at the FBI lab. 
	 The defense has also suggested that McVeigh's clothes could  
have become contaminated at the Noble County prison in Perry, 
Oklahoma, where McVeigh was first held. 
	 Burmeister conceded he made no attempt in May 1995 to find  
out whether anyone who had recently been jailed had handled 
explosives or if employees at the jail had been in contact with 
explosives. 
	 No explosives residue nor ammonium nitrate were found in  
McVeigh's car, despite a vigorous search, Burmeister said.
