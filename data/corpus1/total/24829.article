the strongest language yet in the standoff with Iraq, saying ``bombing 
is an option'' if President Saddam Hussein continues to defy the United 
Nations. 
	Cohen told Pentagon reporters today officials are still ``seeking to  
resolve this as soon as we can diplomatically.'' But he made clear that 
military force is being considered if Saddam maintains his refusal to 
allow U.N. weapons inspectors of all nationalities into his country. 
	The defense chief said, ``Inspectors on the ground are ultimately  
what we want to get back in place. We are going to insist that that take 
place and insist upon compliance, and so bombing is an option...if 
(Saddam) were ever to attack one of our (surveillance) aircraft, the U- 
2, that could invite a rather prompt response, and it would be military 
in nature, but we haven't ruled anything else out beyond that. So we're 
not looking to bomb anyone back into either a Stone Age or into any sort 
of submission, but we're seeking to emphasize the fact that we expect 
compliance with the resolutions.'' 
	Iraqi officials say hundreds of civilians have begun sleeping near  
strategic sites in an effort to deter U.S. air strikes. Cohen, in 
another direct threat, said, ``Hopefully they won't be sleeping too near 
where they're manufacturing sarin gas and VX and other types of poisons. 
'' 
	He later said officials are always concerned about the impact of  
military action on civilians, and that he thinks it unsafe for anyone to 
sleep near where nerve agents are being manufactured. 
	Earlier in the day, President Clinton announced that a second  
aircraft carrier, the USS George Washington, will join the Nimitz in the 
Gulf in about a week. Cohen said other military assets may also be sent 
to the region, adding, ``Nothing has been ruled out.''
