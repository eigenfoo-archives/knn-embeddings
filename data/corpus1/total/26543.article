(HAMAS) has gained in popularity since the return to Gaza City in 
October of its spiritual leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, according to a 
poll published Monday. 
   Seventeen percent of the 1,180 Palestinians surveyed by the  
independent Palestinian Jerusalem Media and Communication Center 
said they support HAMAS, the main opposition group to Palestinian 
President Yasser Arafat. 
   Only 11 percent said in July that they backed HAMAS.  
   Yassin, who had been serving a life sentence in Israel, was  
released as part of a deal between the Jewish state and Jordan 
following a botched Israeli attempt to assassinate a HAMAS political 
official in Amman. 
   Arafat's group, Fatah, was still by far the most popular among  
Palestinians, with 41 percent support in the latest poll, compared 
to 36 percent in July. 
   The vast majority of Palestinians also still are behind the  
peace process with Israel despite the lack of progress over the past 
nine months. 
   Seventy-four percent of those questioned said they support the  
peace process while 69 percent said in July that they backed it. 
   The poll had a margin of error of three percent.
