woman at the age of 86, Mother Teresa of Calcutta met Pope John 
Paul II Tuesday to introduce her successor as head of her 
worldwide missionary order. 
	 The ``saint of the gutters'' appeared equally at home amid  
the frescoed rooms of the Vatican's Apostolic Palace as she does 
in the slums of India, where her help for the poor has made her 
famous. 
	 Mother Teresa, who needed oxygen at Rome airport when she  
arrived Friday, appeared in good condition during her 30-minute 
meeting with the pope. 
	 ``She is now superior-general. I am completely free,''  
Mother Teresa told the pope as she introduced Sister Nirmala in 
the pontiff's frescoed private study. 
	 Both nuns wore the traditional white and blue sari habit of  
the order of nuns founded by the Albanian-born Mother Teresa to 
help the ``poorest of the poor'' around the world. 
	 Sister Nirmala, a 62-year-old Indian, took over as  
superior-general of the Calcutta-based Missionaries of Charity 
in March when Mother Teresa stepped down after a battle against 
heart disease. 
	 The pope, who turned 77 Sunday and has himself had a series  
of health problems in recent years, responded ``I am well'' when 
Sister Nirmala asked how he was doing. 
	 ``When you were very sick we prayed for you,'' Mother Teresa  
told the pope, whom she has met many times in the past. Their 
most memorable visit was when the pope visited her home for the 
dying in the slums of Calcutta in 1986. 
	 Mother Teresa asked the pope to ``pray for China'' and he  
responded that he did so ``every day.'' 
	 ``God bless the new superior-general and all the sisters,''  
the pope said as the delegation left his study. 
	 The Nobel Peace Prize winner was given oxygen for about 20  
minutes in a VIP lounge at Rome airport when she felt tired 
after arriving from New Delhi Friday. 
	 But doctors and aides said there was no cause for alarm and  
that she has been well since. 
	 The other main reason for her visit to Rome is to attend two  
initiation ceremonies where new nuns joining her order will take 
their vows. 
	 Mother Teresa was admitted to the hospital three times last  
year for emergency care and heart surgery. 
	 She has said she would also like to accompany the Pope to  
Poland for part of his visit there next month and perhaps travel 
to the United States if she is well enough.
