have brokered an agreement in principle for Zaire's veteran 
President Mobutu Sese Seko to stand down, a South African 
official said on Sunday. 
	 ``There is an agreement in principle for Mobutu's  
resignation and the launching of a transitional process,'' the 
official, who asked not to be named, told reporters on the South 
African ship SAS Outeniqua shortly before Mobutu boarded for 
peace talks. 
	 South Africa's Nelson Mandela and other senior negotiators  
were already on board with rebel leader Laurent Kabila and South 
African officials. 
	 Mobutu, who has dominated the sprawling nation at the heart  
of Africa since seizing power in 1965, wore his trade-mark 
leopard-skin hat. Witnesses said he looked grim-faced and sad. 
He held the hand of his wife Bobi Ladawa with one hand. In the 
other he held his usual carved walking stick. 
	 South Africa's foreign and defence ministers Alfred Nzo and  
Joe Modise welcomed the veteran leader on board the customised 
icebreaker moored in Congo's port of Pointe Noire. 
	 Once Mobutu was safely on board the crew began preparing the  
ship to leave the Pointe Noire harbour, witnesses said. 
	 Mandela had spent two nights on the boat. Kabila, who failed  
to join Mandela and Mobutu in international waters on Friday as 
initially planned, boarded the ship by helicopter late on 
Saturday. Kabila cited security concerns for his late arrival. 
	 Kabila's rebels, who took up arms in October, control three  
quarters of Zaire and are marching in force on the capital 
Kinshasa.
