the campaign against landmines and its coordinator Jody Williams in 
Oslo on Wednesday, as the laureates in literature, physics, 
chemistry, medicine and economics were honoured at a solemn prize 
ceremony in Stockholm's Concert House. 
   A 37-year old Cambodian man who lost his legs in a 1982 landmine  
accident, Tun Channareth, accepted the Peace Prize on behalf of the 
International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL) at Oslo's City Hall. 
   Williams, the 47-year old American coordinator of the umbrella  
organisation that groups 1,000 non-governmental and humanitarian 
organisations in 60 countries, bowed and clasped her hands before 
Channareth as she stepped forward to receive her prize from the 
chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, Francis Sejersted. 
   As Williams and Channareth, seated in a wheelchair, held up  
their 18-carat gold Nobel medals, the invited guests broke into a 
long, roaring applause. 
   Dressed in a black glittery pantsuit and upswept hair, Williams  
called the tribute "the result of the truly historic achievement of 
this humanitarian effort to rid the world of one indiscriminate 
weapon", a weapon she described as "the perfect soldier, the eternal 
sentry". 
   Owing largely to the efforts of ICBL, which was created in 1991,  
a treaty banning landmines was signed by 121 countries in Ottawa on 
December 4. 
   Worldwide representatives of ICBL -- the cause supported  
passionately by the late Princess Diana -- attended Wednesday's 
ceremony in Oslo, as well as MPs and diplomats. Norway's King Harald 
V and Queen Sonja held the place of honour. 
   Speaking on behalf of ICBL, Rae McGrath said the organisation is  
"driven ... to bring to a halt the unacceptable impact of the 
anti-personnel mine on people". 
   "It is the indiscriminate nature of the anti-personnel landmine,  
the fact that it is triggered by its victim, that it remains active 
indefinitely after conflicts ease, which make it different than any 
other weapon," he said, dedicating the prize to "all victims of 
landmines". 
   American country singer Emmy Lou Harris sang two songs in honour  
of the laureates in Oslo, while the ten prizewinners in Stockholm 
received their awards in a solemn ceremony. 
   Dressed in tailcoats with white tie, the laureates received  
their Nobel medals one by one from the hands of Sweden's King Carl 
XVI Gustaf to strains of Mozart, Beethoven, Berlioz, Mahler and 
Stravinsky. 
   The laureates are American Steven Chu, Claude Cohen-Tannoudji of  
France and William Phillips of the US for physics, Paul Boyer of the 
US, John Walker of Britain and Jens Skou of Denmark for chemistry, 
American Stanley Prusiner for medicine, Dario Fo of Italy for 
literature and Americans Robert Merton and Myron Scholes for 
economics. 
   They were warmly applauded by the 1,800 invited guests attending  
the ceremony at the Concert Hall, which was decorated with orange 
and yellow flowers and a light blue carpet inscribed with the gold 
Nobel "N". 
   The biggest round of applause came when a rosy-cheeked and  
smiling Dario Fo, a jester and dramatist, received his award. He 
surprised many by performing no antics during the formal ceremony. 
   Presenting Fo, the head of the Swedish Academy, Sture Allen,  
noted that "being a jester is serious business", and compared him to 
Irish playwright (eds: correct) George Bernard Shaw. 
   "Shaw was honoured for his idealism and humanity, his  
stimulating satire often infused with a singular poetic beauty. So 
different yet the same words can be applied to Dario Fo," Allen 
said. 
   Perhaps in Fo's honour, Stravinsky's "Circus Polka for a Young  
Elephant" was played after he received his prize. 
   Sweden's Queen Silvia shone at the event, wearing a turquoise  
and black off-the-shoulder full gown and bejewelled tiara. The same 
went for 20-year-old Crown Princess Victoria, who wore a slender 
lilac dress and matching full-length jacket with a diamond tiara. 
   In addition to the prize, all of the laureates were awarded a  
cheque for 7.5 million kronor (one million dollars), to be shared 
when more than one laureate is honoured in a discipline. 
   Later in the evening, a record 1,346 guests attended the Nobel  
banquet, held at Stockholm City Hall's Blue Room. Tickets for the 
lavish dinner -- for which the menu is always a tightly-kept secret 
until the last minute -- cost 1,650 kronor (220 dollars). 
   The Nobel Prize ceremonies are held every year on the  
anniversary of the death of prize creator Alfred Nobel in San Remo, 
Italy, in 1896.
