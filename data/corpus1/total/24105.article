of the Catholic Church and God, according to 60 Christian theologians 
participating in a three-day Vatican conference on anti-Semitism. 
	A strongly-worded communique issued Sunday said: ``Christians who  
yield to anti-Judaism offend God and offend the Church.'' 
	Pope John Paul II also condemned the holocaust, but stopped short of  
criticizing a predecessor, Pope Pius XII, sometimes accused of silence 
during World War II. 
	He called instead for a ``purification of memory.''  
	On October 27, the European representative of the Los Angeles-based  
Simon Wiesenthal Center asked the pope to open the Vatican archives 
relating to the Pius XII era to the public. ``During World War II, the 
Church sold its soul to the devil,'' said Simon Samuels of the 
Wiesenthal Center in Paris. 
	Pope John Paul II has praised Pius XII, who critics say could have  
done more for persecuted Jews. 
	Roman Catholic, Protestant and Orthodox theologians attended the  
conference, although no Jewish observers were allowed into the closed- 
door seminar.
