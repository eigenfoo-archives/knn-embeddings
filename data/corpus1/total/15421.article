repatriate Rwandan Hutu refugees, already delayed by logistical 
problems, disease and opposition from local residents, was 
further postponed Sunday until at least May. 
	 The governor of Eastern Province (formerly Upper Zaire),  
physician Yagi Sitolo, said the operation should not start until 
May 5 because of a cholera epidemic. 
	 The governor intervened last week to delay a plan to start  
an airlift this weekend of up to 100,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees 
>from  two jungle camps south of Kisangani. 
	 His reason then was that a cholera outbreak among the  
refugees threatened local Zairians. 
	 ``If the epidemic is well controlled, it should die down by  
May 5 and we could start repatriation,'' Sitolo told Reuters in 
Kisangani Sunday. 
	 ``But for medical reasons it shouldn't start before then,''  
said Sitolo, who was elected with the blessing of the rebels 
last month. 
	 The water supply to surrounding villages was polluted by the  
burial of cholera-infected bodies, he said, and he challenged 
aid workers to drink the water being used by villagers. 
	 About 100,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees have been living in  
horrific conditions at Biaro and Kasese camps since rebels of 
the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo/ 
Zaire (AFDL) captured Kisangani March 15. 
	 The death toll from cholera, malaria and malnutrition stands  
at around 40 a day, with bodies lined up under blankets along a 
mud road leading through the camps. 
	 Aid workers Sunday accused Zairian rebels of playing games  
with the lives of Rwandan refugees and said many faced death 
because of delays in their repatriation. 
	 ``The situation at the moment is completely unacceptable,''  
one aid worker told Reuters. ``We need to put pressure on the 
Alliance (rebels), on governments, on whoever it takes to get 
those people out of there.'' 
	 Sitolo said residents were already at risk from the cholera  
outbreak at Kasese camp and would be in even greater danger if 
refugees were driven by truck to Kisangani airport for 
repatriation. 
	 ``I want the refugees to go home. But I must also look after  
the local population who are very fragile,'' Sitolo said. 
	 The U.N. refugee agency UNHCR has dismissed such fears as  
groundless, and an official from the U.S.-based Centers for 
Disease Control flew to Kisangani Saturday to add weight to the 
argument. 
	 ``At the moment they (the authorities) are just playing  
games with people's lives,'' one aid worker said. 
	 Twenty-three new cholera cases were reported Friday,  
bringing the total to 408 since mid-March. Some 42 people have 
died from the disease, according to UNHCR figures. 
	 Angry local people broke the windshield of a U.N. vehicle  
returning from the camps Saturday on the second day of protests 
against the refugees and the presence of aid workers. 
	 Privately, aid officials say they fear the protests may be  
orchestrated by the Alliance to cover up a shift in policy over 
the planned repatriation. Sitolo denied this. 
	 Aid officials speculated that Rwanda, which has been given  
little or no aid with resettlement, could be becoming 
overwhelmed by the continuing flood of returning refugees, and 
so was putting pressure on the Alliance to halt the 
repatriation. 
	 Alternatively, they say, the change could indicate a split  
between rebel leaders and local Zairian leaders. 
	 More than a million Hutu refugees fled East Zaire camps last  
October and November, at the start of the advance by rebels who 
control more than half of the vast country and are threatening 
the capital Kinshasa. 
	 Most refugees returned home from Zaire in November but  
hundreds of thousands fled west -- including members of the 
former Rwandan army and the militia held responsible for 
massacres during the 1994 Rwanda genocide.
