prison'' outside a Bordeaux court Monday when accused Nazi 
collaborator Maurice Papon, free on bail, arrived for the 
resumption of his trial for crimes against humanity. 
	 The demonstrators were protesting the court's decision last  
week to release the 87-year-old ex-cabinet minister on bail for 
the duration of his trial on grounds of his age and frailty. 
	 Papon, who became a cabinet minister in a meteoric post-war  
career, is accused of ordering the arrests and deportation of 
1,560 Jews, including 223 children, when he was a senior 
official in the collaborationist Vichy regime in Bordeaux during 
World War II. 
	 Handed to the Germans, nearly all were gassed at the  
infamous Auschwitz concentration camp. 
	 Papon's trial began Wednesday but the court unleashed a wave  
of outrage when it decided Friday to free him on bail between 
the hearings rather than keep him in jail. 
	 Papon spent two nights in prison last week and a third in  
the hospital after being transferred from his cell with a heart 
complaint. 
	 The public prosecutor appealed against the ruling and  
several hundred demonstrators gathered outside the court 
carrying pictures of the children killed at Auschwitz to protest 
the decision. 
	 ``Go ahead, take their pictures,'' a woman with a  
tear-streaked face told a photographer. ``No one released them. 
They were sent off in sealed cars separated from their 
mothers.'' 
	 Dozens of stark yellow placards carrying the children's  
names and ages were hoisted above the crowd. Among them were 
``Andre Sztoyner, five months old,'' ``Colette Allouche, four 
years old'' and ``Albert Fogiel, six years old.'' 
	 The indignation of relatives, many of them plaintiffs in the  
trial, was brought to a pitch by television footage of Papon 
walking freely over the weekend outside a luxurious country 
hotel where he took refuge under police protection. 
	 Papon left the hotel for a more modest one Monday after the  
mayor of the town where the country retreat was located 
protested his presence. 
	 But Andre Rousset, mayor of the Bordeaux suburb of Pessac  
where Papon checked into a three-star hotel, told reporters: 
``He is not welcome here. His presence is an attack on the 
memory of victims of Nazism.'' 
	 Papon's lawyer Jean-Marc Varaut said his client had little  
choice of hotels since most turned him down despite French law 
forbidding them to refuse clients. 
	 Papon looked calm and attentive when he appeared in the  
courtroom, where lawyers for the plaintiffs accused the court of 
extending ``untoward clemency'' to him. 
	 Nazi hunter Serge Klarsfeld accused court president  
Jean-Louis Castagnede of depriving the jury of its rights since, 
even if Papon is sentenced to the maximum life imprisonment, he 
will remain free until he has exhausted all appeals, a process 
that could take years. 
	 Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin expressed surprise at  
the freeing of Papon, saying: ``I deeply regret that, in the 
event of a conviction, it will strip the ruling of any effect 
other than moral for a long time.'' 
	 Castagnede tried to calm the anger by saying Papon would  
return to prison, if only for a few days, if the jurors' court 
found him guilty. 
	 The trial resumed with the court beginning to hear the  
accusations against Papon, which run into more than 150 pages 
and will take part of Tuesday's hearing. 
	 Papon's political career came to an abrupt halt in 1981,  
when he was French budget minister, after a newspaper published 
documents unveiling his hitherto unknown role in deporting Jews.
