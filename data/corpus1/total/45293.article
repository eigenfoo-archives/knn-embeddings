rioting Monday as Palestinians protesting in support of prisoners on 
hunger strike in Israeli jails clashed with Israeli troops and in 
some cases Palestinian police. 
   More than 30 Palestinians were wounded by rubber-coated bullets  
fired by Israeli troops in the clashes, which broke out in cities 
and towns throughout the West Bank, witnesses and medical workers 
said. 
   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused the  
Palestinian Authority of fomenting the campaign of protests over the 
prisoner issue and last week froze further Israeli withdrawals from 
the West Bank required under the recent Wye River peace accord due 
to the violence. 
   But in Nablus in the north of the West Bank, Palestinian police  
beat back hundreds of protestors calling for the release of 
detainees as they approached a Jewish shrine guarded by Israeli 
soldiers on the outskirts of the city, witnesses said. 
   A crowd of some 3,000 gathered at the city's an-Najah university  
and marched to the municipality building near the shrine of Joseph's 
tomb, they said. 
   A force of about 150 Palestinian police stationed in front of  
the municipality beat the demonstrators back with batons, injuring 
three, as demonstrators tried to break through barricades near the 
tomb, the witnesses said. 
   The situation in Nablus was later calm.  
   In Bethlehem, south of Jerusalem, Israeli soldiers opened fire  
with teargas and rubber-coated metal bullets on several hundred 
Palestinians who broke through a Palestinian police checkpoint near 
an Israeli army position, witnesses said. 
   At least 20 of the protestors were wounded in the melee, the  
witnesses said. 
   In Hebron, three Palestinians were wounded by rubber-coated  
bullets as dozens of youths threw stones at Israeli troops on the 
periphery of the Israeli-controlled Jewish settlement in the city 
center, witnesses said. 
   Some 800 protestors had marched towards the demarcation line  
dividing the Palestinian and Israeli-controlled parts of the town, 
the witnesses said. 
   Eight Palestinians were also injured near Ramallah when hundreds  
of demonstrators marching through the adjacent town of al-Bireh 
clashed with Israeli troops on the edge of the city, witnesses 
said. 
   In Tulkarem in the north of the West Bank, Israeli troops fired  
in the air as 800 protesters pelted the Israeli-Palestinian security 
liaison office in the town, witnesses said. 
   And in nearby Salfit, 150 Palestinian protestors clashed with  
Israeli soldiers who responded with tear-gas and rubber-coated 
bullets, witnesses said. 
   There were no reports of any injuries in Salfit or Tulkarem.  
   Palestinian protestors have been clashing with Israeli troops  
nearly daily since Israel last month included 150 common criminals 
in the release of 250 Palestinian prisoners required under the Wye 
River accord. 
   The Palestinian Authority says that under the US-brokered  
agreement reached in October, Israel should free 750 militants 
detained for their political activities. 
   But Netanyuahu, backed by the agreement's US brokers, insists  
Israel is free to choose which prisoners to release and will not 
free anyone involved in violence or who rejects peace accords with 
the Jewish state. 
   Last week Netanyahu's cabinet said it would not carry out a  
further withdrawal from the West Bank scheduled for December 18 
under the Wye accord unless the Palestinian Authority stopped 
alleged incitement to violence and acknowledged publicly that Israel 
is not obliged by the peace agreement to free political detainees. 
   In response to his stance, many of the Palestinian militants  
held in Israeli jails on Saturday began an open-ended hunger strike 
in protest at their continued detention and at the perceived 
capitulation of Palestinian negotiators to Israeli demands on the 
prisoner issue. 
   Prisoners families have also organized a 10-day program of  
protests, marches and strikes culminating in the visit of US 
President Bill Clinton who is due to arrive for a visit to Israel 
and the Palestinian territories on Saturday.
