in Ukraine's worst mining disaster in recent memory will be 
buried on Monday amid bitter complaints from survivors about 
safety standards and unpaid wages. 
	 A lethal mixture of methane gas and coal dust exploded more  
than a kilometre (nearly a mile) below the eastern city of 
Donetsk on Saturday morning, catching two groups of face workers 
as they changed shifts in section six of the Skochinsky pit. 
	 By Sunday evening, rescue workers had braved the threat of  
new explosions to bring all the bodies to the surface. 
	 Of some 600 others working below ground at the time of the  
blast, 43 were in hospital, 13 in a critical condition. 
	 Deputy Prime Minister Nikolai Beloblotsky, heading an  
investigation into the accident at the state-run mine, called it 
a ``national tragedy.'' Monday will be a day of national 
mourning. 
	 The government, Beloblotsky said, would do all it could to  
help the families of victims. Widows will be entitled to five 
years pay or about $12,000 in all, officials said. 
	 Many of the dead were young apprentices brought in recently  
to work the newly-opened seam where the blast happened. 
	 ``My little boy, my baby,'' wailed one woman as she was  
helped away from the pithead by a relative, barely able to walk. 
	 A local official helping organise Monday's funerals told  
Reuters the families of some of the dead had even more pressing 
worries. ``They're not asking for new flats or huge sums of 
money. They want something to feed their children,'' she said. 
	 The leader of the local miners' union told Reuters he did  
not believe the explosion had been anything other than a natural 
disaster at a pit recognised as very prone to methane build-ups. 
	 ``I think this was a pure accident. Nothing could be done,''  
local miners' union leader Valery Miller told Reuters. 
	 But the catastrophe became a catalyst for anger among the  
miners of Donetsk, the centre of Ukraine's important Donbass 
coal region, over poor conditions, low wages and delays of many 
months in actually receiving any pay at all. 
	 Ukraine's mines have earned a reputation for danger and  
death, especially since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 
left many pits in financial crisis. In 1997, 335 miners died in 
Ukraine, a similar level to previous years. 
	 Rescue workers and survivors said some men were poisoned by  
gas because their personal breathing apparatus did not work. 
	 ``We're not just sitting on a powder keg, we're inside the  
barrel of a gun and it's always about to go off,'' Nikolai 
Galushko, a foreman at Skochinsky, said of the methane problem. 
	 For the risks they run, coalface workers at the 23-year-old  
mine are considered well off locally with monthly wages around 
$200 -- but those wages are four months overdue, they said. 
	 ``Before 1991 miners used to take a lunch with them to work.  
Now most can't afford it. A man with a potato, an onion and a 
loaf of bread is considered a wealthy man. He normally would 
share with the rest,'' said survivor Gennady Moskovsky. 
	 ``The whole system is to blame,'' said his workmate  
Alexander Chirva, who was also caught by the blast. Moskovsky 
added: ``The boss isn't hungry, he always has something to 
eat.'' 
	 Both men said many of their fellow survivors wanted to quit  
the industry. But they doubted they could. 
	 ``It's all emotion,'' Chirva said. ``They've nowhere else to  
go, probably just another mine, so it's all the same.'' 
	 In a previous serious accident at Skochinsky, two miners and  
15 rescue workers died in an explosion and fire in 1992. That 
same year, 60 were killed in a gas explosion at another Donbass 
pit. Four months ago in Russia's Kuzbass coalfield in Siberia, 
68 died in a methane explosion and fire at Novokuznetsk.
