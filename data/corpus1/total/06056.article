on a ranch near this remote Montana town Friday after a family 
of four left the land where an anti-government group known as 
the Freemen has been involved in a 10-week standoff with federal 
agents. 
	 Officials identified the four who left the compound as Elwin  
Ward, 55; Gloria Ward, also known as Tamara Mangum, 35; her two 
daughters, Jaylynn Joy Mangum, 8, and Courtney Joy Christensen, 
10. The girls are daughters from previous marriages. 
	 The four were driven by convoy to FBI headquarters at the  
county fairgrounds. Gloria Ward was seen on the FBI grounds 
walking with her two daughters. 
	 At a hearing late Thursday, a Montana judge temporarily gave  
the FBI custody of the two girls for a trip back to Utah, where 
further custody hearings may be held, a court source said. 
	 The girls' aunt, Lynn Nielsen, has an order granting her  
temporary custody, but Utah authorities may challenge that 
order, according to the court source. 
	 The standoff began March 25 when FBI agents arrested two  
Freemen leaders, charged with taking part in a $1.8 million 
check fraud scheme, threatening a federal judge and stealing 
equipment at gunpoint from a news crew. Several Freemen who 
refuse to leave the ranch face similar charges. 
	 The departure of the family followed steps in the past week  
by federal authorities to tighten the noose around the group. 
The FBI has shut off electricity to the ranch, moved armored 
vehicles into the vicinity and flown a helicopter over the area. 
	 Sherry Matteucci, U.S. Attorney for Montana, called the  
departure a ``hopeful indication'' but said she could not 
speculate if others will leave the compound. Some 16 adults and 
one child are believed to be left on the ranch. 
	 Matteucci said charges against Gloria Ward for a child  
custody violation in Utah have been dismissed. There are no 
federal charges pending against either adult. 
	 In Washington, Justice Department spokesman Carl Stern said  
the family left in response to pleas from Gloria Ward's sister, 
Nielsen. She accompanied the Ward family when they left the 
ranch. 
	 John Tanner, an attorney for Gloria Ward's sister, confirmed  
that the woman Thursday had hand-delivered a letter to the ranch 
>from  John Chaney, who is in jail, saying he had a revelation 
>from  God that the family should leave. 
	 Chaney, 39, is married to a third underage daughter of  
Gloria Ward's. The 15-year-old girl is in foster care in 
Michigan. Chaney is in jail awaiting a trial on rape conspiracy 
charges for allegedly trying to marry off his own underage 
daughter to a 48-year-old man, according to the Salt Lake City 
Tribune. 
	 The Freemen reject government authority and hold white  
supremacist ``Christian Identity'' beliefs. 
	 The FBI, sensitive about the criticism it received following  
a 1993 attack on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, 
has taken a low-key approach in Montana. The Waco compound was 
burned to the ground in a federal assault and more than 80 
people were killed. 
	 Attorney General Janet Reno Thursday repeated that the FBI  
wants to resolve the standoff peacefully despite steps to 
increase pressure on the group.
