''Che'' Guevara was killed trying to spark revolution in Boliva, 
Cuba finally buried the legendary leftist guerrilla Friday as a 
national hero. 
	 Factory sirens and car horns blared out across the island in  
a minute's tribute after a solemn funeral ceremony in the 
central city of Santa Clara, where Guevara's remains were buried 
in a specially built mausoleum. 
	 President Fidel Castro said Guevara would never die, living  
on as an example and an inspiration for those who fought for 
justice in the world, and reinforcing Cuba's determination to 
preserve its socialist system. 
	 ``As you see, this land that is yours, this people that is  
yours, this revolution that is yours are still flying the flags 
of socialism,'' Castro told the packed ceremony in Santa Clara's 
Revolution Square. 
	 ``Thank you for coming to reinforce us in the difficult  
struggle that we are undergoing today to preserve the ideas that 
you fought so hard for,'' said the 71-year-old Cuban leader, 
reading an emotional tribute to the man who was his lieutenant 
in the struggle that led to Cuba's 1959 revolution. 
	 Guevara was a prophet who had become ``a symbol for all the  
poor of the world,'' Castro said, adding his image would grow 
larger the more the world was blighted with imperialism, 
poverty, cowardice and hypocrisy. 
	 He would remain everywhere ``where there is a just cause to  
defend,'' said Castro. 
	 Guevara, an Argentine-born doctor, was captured by Bolivian  
troops Oct. 8, 1967, while leading an abortive rebel mission 
there, and executed the following day. 
	 His idealistic crusade and early death made him a beacon for  
a generation of leftists around the world. 
	 His remains, flung into a secret mass grave near the  
Bolivian town of Vallegrande, were unearthed and returned to 
Cuba just three months ago. 
	 The remains were buried along with the remains of six former  
comrades-in-arms who died with him on the Bolivia mission -- 
four Cubans, a Bolivian and a Peruvian. 
	 Santa Clara, 300 km (220 miles) southeast of Havana, was  
captured by Guevara Jan. 1, 1959, in a battle that was decisive 
for the victory of Castro's rebel army against former dictator 
Fulgencio Batista. 
	 After Castro's tribute, pairs of soldiers in dress uniform  
carried the seven small caskets into the mausoleum, watched by 
family members and by Castro and his brother Raul Castro. 
	 Guevara's widow and four children live in Cuba and his two  
brothers and a sister came from Argentina for the ceremony. 
	 The crowd, some waving flags, others portraits of Guevara,  
waited outside in brilliant sunshine. 
	 Cuba, struggling to preserve Cuba's one-party socialist  
system amid the isolation of the post-Soviet era, has seized on 
the 30th anniversary of Guevara's death and the fact it 
recovered his remains to revitalize the guerrilla's image and 
present his ideas as more relevant than ever. 
	 The homage to Guevara began Saturday in Havana when the  
remains of Guevara and his six fallen comrades were placed on 
display in Revolution Square. Tuesday, they were brought to 
Santa Clara and placed on display for two days. 
	 By Friday, hundreds of thousands of Cubans had been  
mobilized by workplaces, schools and neighbourhood committees to 
take part in the tribute. It was hard to say how many came 
because they wanted to and how many because they felt obliged. 
	 But the figure of Che, forever preserved as a young and  
handsome idealist, commands a particular respect among many 
Cubans, even those critical of the present government. 
	 Castro ended his tribute repeating Guevara's famous words in  
his farewell letter to the Cuban leader when he left the island 
in 1965 to try to export revolution abroad. 
	 ``Until victory always,'' he said.
