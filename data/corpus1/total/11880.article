several others were missing after a massive explosion rocked an 
airplane parts plant Monday, officials said. 
	 Rescue workers were searching through the charred plant for  
other victims who might be trapped inside the wreckage. 
	 A spokeswoman for the Cy-Fair Volunteer Fire Department told  
Reuters that rescue teams at the scene ``said there were nine 
dead and they were looking for six more people'' in the rubble. 
	 But officials said the death toll was unknown because of the  
difficulty of searching through the wreckage. 
	 Two other workers at the plant were injured and taken to a  
local hospital, where officials said they were in stable 
condition. 
	 Investigators said they were looking into the possibility  
that the explosion may have been touched off by a welding torch 
being used by maintenance workers near equipment driven by a 
high-pressure pump. 
	 ``What we do know is that they were working with a torch in  
that part of the plant,'' said firefighter Corinne Engelbrecht. 
	''Right now our only priority is to get the patients who are  
still viable out.'' 
	 Search dogs were scouring nearby fields and helicopters flew  
overhead scanning the area for body parts and possible clues to 
the explosion. 
	 The blast took place at a plant owned by Wyman Gordon  
Forging Inc. The company, which makes airplane parts and bomb 
casings, would not immediately comment on the tragedy. 
	 News reports said the force of the explosion threw workers  
as high as three stories into the air, although that could not 
be confirmed. They said some of the victims had to be pried from 
the wreckage. 
	 The plant, located on the outskirts of Houston, appeared to  
be mostly intact except for one section that was blown out by 
the explosion. 
	 Workers at the plant milled outside the front gates and said  
they had been told nothing about what had happened or how many 
had died. 
	 ``I didn't hear about it until I got here this morning. You  
think about your workers first,'' Wyman Gordon employee Buddy 
Walton told reporters.
