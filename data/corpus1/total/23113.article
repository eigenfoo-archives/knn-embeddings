against visiting U.S. President Clinton turned violent when a 
small group of students smashed the windows of foreign banks and 
tossed in molotov cocktails. 
	 A column of several thousand leftist political parties and  
students was marching Thursday toward the Rural Society, where 
Clinton and his wife Hillary were later due to attend a state 
dinner, when masked youths broke away and attacked bank offices. 
	 A Reuters correspondent said a few dozen youths wearing red  
scarves on their faces daubed the banks with anti-Clinton 
graffiti and slogans of radical student group Quebracho, after 
smashing windows and throwing firebombs which soon burnt out. 
	 ``Clinton Go Home!'' read the slogans sprayed on the  
branches of Citibank and Lloyds bank in the busy middle-class 
Palermo district of Buenos Aires. 
	 But most of the protesters, drawn from Argentine communist  
and socialist parties and student groups, did not take part in 
the violence, preferring to chant slogans against Clinton and 
the International Monetary Fund. 
	 Argentine riot police equipped with water cannons and full  
riot gear arrived on the scene. 
	 Earlier, police arrested 12 Argentines wearing ``Clinton Go  
Home'' T-shirts minutes before Bill Clinton arrived to lay a 
wreath to Argentina's national hero with President Carlos Menem. 
	 The protesters were released after questioning, police said.
