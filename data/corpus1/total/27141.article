glistened with tinsel and bristled with weapons Wednesday as 
Palestinian-ruled Bethlehem prepared to usher in Christmas Eve. 
	 Israeli troops sealed the entrance to the PLO-ruled enclave  
for two hours, holding back scores of Christian clergy and 
Palestinian Christians from Jerusalem while army sappers dealt 
with a bomb scare. 
	 In the town's heart, hundreds of Palestinian police on high  
alert for potential unrest outnumbered the few foreigners making 
pilgrimage to Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity. 
	 ``Every holiday you do something like this, you're making it  
a war zone,'' Abla Nassar, a Palestinian Christian trying to 
enter Bethlehem before the Latin Patriarch's traditional 
procession, shouted at Israeli troops. 
	 Nassar's outburst was received by waves of applause by  
fellow pilgrims held up at the Israeli checkpoint at the town's 
outskirts. 
	 ``They don't want people to celebrate. They don't want us to  
be happy. They want to humiliate the people,'' Nassar, dressed 
in her holiday best, told Reuters. 
	 Some elderly Palestinians returned to Jerusalem, hoping that  
next Christmas will be better. 
	 Younger Palestinians took a detour over muddy hills to  
bypass Israeli soldiers and join holiday merry-makers -- both 
Christian and Muslim -- gathering in Manger Square next to the 
grotto where tradition holds Jesus was born. 
	 In the square, a band played carols in the shadow of the  
decorated Christmas tree lit Tuesday by Palestinian President 
Yasser Arafat's Christian-born wife, Suha. 
	 ``Of course, we celebrate Christmas festivities with the  
Christians,'' said Bassma, a veiled Muslim Palestinian woman 
from Bethlehem. ``They are our countrymen. Their joy is our 
joy.'' 
	 Bethlehem Mayor Hana Nasser expects 5,000 to 6,000 pilgrims  
to fill Manger Square on Christmas Eve to celebrate midnight 
mass in the Roman Catholic church next to the Orthodox Christian 
Church of the Nativity. 
	 The city, whose 35,000 Palestinian residents are one-third  
Christian and two-thirds Muslim, is celebrating its third 
Christmas under Palestinian Authority self-rule. 
	 But much of the nationalist joy that greeted the city's  
liberation from three decades of Israeli occupation in 1995 has 
faded. 
	 Israeli security closures, travel restrictions and Islamist  
suicide bombings have contributed to Bethlehem's economic woes 
since Israel and the PLO struck a landmark interim peace deal in 
1993. 
	 Unemployment is high, incomes have fallen sharply and the  
lucrative holy land tourism industry has slowed to a trickle. 
	 ``Our family was scared but when we called them yesterday  
and told them how safe it is here and how Palestinians are kind, 
they wished they were with us here in the holiest Christian city 
on earth,'' said Peter Dennis, a British tourist. 
	 The Palestinian police were determined to keep celebrations  
orderly. 
	 ``We have everything prepared: ambulances, interference  
police in case of chaos,'' said Abu Ahmad, a 35-year-old 
policeman. ``But I don't think anything will happen. People are 
here to have fun and make the best of the holidays.'' 
	 Californian Cindy Hartwell, 47, wondered what all the fuss  
over security was about, describing the atmosphere as ``so 
soothing to the heart.'' 
	 ``Just the feeling of being here is so holy, the people are  
super-kind and hospitable everywhere we go in Bethlehem,'' she 
said.
