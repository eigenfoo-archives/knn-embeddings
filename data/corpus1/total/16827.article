Oklahoma City bombing trial was taking its toll Sunday on 
anxious relatives of bombing victims and on hundreds of 
journalists covering the trial. 
	 Jurors, too, looked worn as they filed into court at noon  
Sunday to hear federal Judge Richard Matsch grant their request 
to take the afternoon off after two and a half days of 
deliberations in the trial of Timothy McVeigh. 
	 ``I'm sure you've deserved the opportunity to rest and relax  
a bit,'' Matsch told the seven men and five women on the jury, 
telling them to return to work Monday with ``renewed vigor.'' 
	 Only the jurors know how the deliberations are going.  
	 McVeigh, a 29-year-old Gulf War veteran, is accused of  
blowing up the Alfred P. Murrah federal building on April 19, 
1995, killing 168 people in the worst mass murder in U.S. 
history. 
	 He has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy and murder charges.  
Although McVeigh could face the death penalty if convicted, he 
has shown little sign of nerves in public, smiling and talking 
animatedly with his attorneys in court. 
	 ``I feel he's doing very well given that this is a pretty  
serious moment in his life,'' defense attorney Christopher 
Tritico said after visiting McVeigh in his courthouse cell. 
	 Matsch and the lawyers showed little sign of stress.  
	 But grieving relatives of the bombing victims -- many of  
whom had hoped for a quick ``guilty'' verdict -- were growing 
worried about the length of deliberations. 
	 ``I'm drinking coffee and smoking a lot of cigarettes,''  
said Jannie Coverdale, whose young grandsons Aaron and Elijah 
were killed in the blast. ``I don't sleep too well at night any 
more,'' said Coverdale, who has attended most of the trial. 
	 The nagging fear in the minds of Coverdale and other  
relatives of bombing victims is that the jury will acquit 
McVeigh or be deadlocked. 
	 Legal analysts say there is nothing unusual about how long  
the jury has deliberated in such a serious case. ``They are 
looking at each and every element. Did each and every element 
get proved up beyond a reasonable doubt?'' Denver defense 
attorney David Japha said. 
	 The jury heard from more than 160 witnesses during five  
weeks of testimony. Prosecutors said McVeigh is a right-wing 
fanatic who wanted to spark a ``second American revolution'' 
while the defense said he is innocent and that the real bomber 
may have died in the blast. 
	 The wait for a verdict is testing the nerves of hundreds of  
journalists from all over the United States and other countries 
who are covering the trial. 
	 Reporters in the newsroom set up at the federal court  
building jump up when word spreads that lawyers involved in the 
case are approaching the court or that a court hearing is to be 
held. They relax when it becomes clear that Matsch is only 
calling the jurors into court to excuse them for the day and not 
because there is a verdict. 
	 Television crews wearing t-shirts, shorts and hats lounge  
around outside the court houseuntil chief defense attorney 
Stephen Jones or another lawyer comes into view, when dozens of 
journalists engulf them and bombard them with questions as they 
walk along. 
	 Uniformed and plainclothes police officers kept a tight  
guard around the court. 
	 Many relatives of the bombing victims are passing the time  
at a ``safe haven'' at a nearby church. ``We watch TV, we laugh, 
we talk, some people are playing cards, some are working 
crossword puzzles. We eat a lot,'' Coverdale said.
