arrived here Sunday for a five-day visit during which he will 
oversee South Africa's switch of formal ties on New Year's Day from 
Taiwan to China. 
   Qian and his delegation were greeted on their arrival at Cape  
Town airport by his South African counterpart Alfred Nzo before 
being being whisked off to an official luncheon hosted by Speaker of 
Parliament Frene Ginwala. 
   In a written statement handed to journalists on his arrival,  
Qian said he believed his visit "will lay a foundation for all-round 
development of the friendly relations and cooperation between our 
two countries in the future." 
   Beijing, he added, had supported the anti-apartheid struggle and  
was now ready to help rebuild the South African economy. 
   The establishment of formal ties, Qian said, "will open up a new  
and broad vista for the development of our friendly cooperation in 
various fields and furtherance on a new basis of the traditional 
friendship between the two peoples." 
   The Chinese foreign minister is scheduled on Monday to visit  
Robben Island former political prison offshore here, where President 
Nelson Mandela spent 18 of his 27 years in apartheid jails, before 
sitting down to lunch with Mandela at the president's official 
residence here. 
   Qian and Nzo will on Tuesday officially sign the agreement  
establishing formal ties between the two countries. 
   South Africa was the last large industrialised country to have  
official ties with Taiwan -- considered by China to be a rebel 
province -- until Mandela announced in November 1996 that Pretoria 
would switch recognition to Beijing. 
   Qian and Nzo will also sign a bilateral agreement on investment  
protection, the foreign ministry said. The Chinese embassy in 
Pretoria will then be officially opened on January 1. 
   China is South Africa's sixth biggest trading partner. Two-way  
trade is expected to reach 1.7 billion dollars this year, on top of 
the 1.4 billion dollars of exchanges between Pretoria and Hong 
Kong. 
   Nzo told journalists at the airport that recognition of Beijing  
was "an inevitable step". 
   "China presents a vibrant growing economy and we look forward to  
a period when both our countries take advantage of this," Nzo said. 
   He said South Africa had managed to agree "with our Taiwanese  
friends that our relations, commercial and trade, will remain in 
place, which for us is of great importance." 
   Taiwan Economy Minister Wang Chih-kang said last week that  
Pretoria had asked that existing economic ties continue after 
January 1 without the protection of diplomatic links. 
   Negotiations for the agreement are expected to get underway next  
year largely aimed at protecting the interests of Taiwan's business 
units in South Africa, Wang said. 
   South Africa's opposition National Party said in a statement  
Sunday that the announcement that South Africa and Taiwan will 
merely maintain economic relations is proof the government yielded 
to pressure from Beijing and the South African Communist Party 
(SACP). 
   Mandela, in announcing the switching of ties, had promised that  
the "highest form of relations short of diplomatic relations" would 
be maintained with Taiwan. 
   Asked if Pretoria had been influenced by the SACP, ally of the  
ruling African National Congress, Nzo emphatically denied it. 
   "We were influenced by no one," he said.  
   Taiwan is South Africa's seventh-ranked trade partner. Two-way  
trade totaled 1.7 billion dollars last year.
