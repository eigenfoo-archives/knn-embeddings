inspectors out of  presidential palaces despite a Security Council 
call for full access but it has eased curbs on other "sensitive" 
sites, the UN disarmament chief said Monday. 
   "The Iraqi side insisted that we would never be able to inspect  
the presidential sites," Richard Butler told a late-night press 
conference after a third round of talks with Iraq's Deputy Prime 
Minister Tareq Aziz. 
   But "we have reached agreement on ways ahead to make access  
easier" to other sensitive sites, said Butler, chairman of the UN 
Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of disarming Iraq. 
   "We have agreed to a categorization of sites within Iraq which  
ranges from normal to sensitive, and then to presidential," said 
Butler, who was to hold a final meeting with Aziz on Tuesday before 
winding up his four-day mission. 
   He voiced confidence that the agreement would give UNSCOM "an  
expanded range of possibilities" to inspect the sensitive sites, 
other than presidential palaces, for weapons secrets. 
   But Iraq's ban on access to palaces was a "derogation from the  
(Security) Council's insistence that UNSCOM should be able to go 
anywhere, and at any time," said Butler, an Australian diplomat. 
   Aziz told Butler, who is to report back to the Security Council  
on Thursday, that Iraq was prepared to "defend" its stand in front 
of the 15-nation Council. 
   The UNSCOM chief said he would return to Baghdad on January 19  
for more talks with Aziz "to see whether or not the Council has 
decided to accept Iraq's reservation on presidential sites. 
   "I expressed great doubt to Mr. Tareq Aziz that it would do  
so." 
   Citing US threats of military action, Iraq refused to provide a  
list of its presidential sites on the grounds that "it might help 
those who want to bomb Iraq to do so more precisely," Butler said. 
   Butler also said no progress was made in unravelling the secrets  
of Baghdad's biological weapons and that a promised report on the 
programme had yet to be handed over, but he declined to classify his 
mission as a failure. 
   "Am I satisfied in the sense that we have got everything  
resolved? Not really. We made good progress, but there are still 
some issues that need to be resolved," he said. 
   Butler said most of the progress was made in technical talks  
between Iraqi officials and UNSCOM weapons experts. 
   A UN oil embargo in force against Baghdad since its August 1990  
invasion of Kuwait can not be lifted until UNSCOM has certified the 
elimination of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons as well as 
long-range missiles. 
   Butler said earlier that the missiles file was the most  
complete, "chemical is looking fairly good, and biology isn't." The 
International Atomic Energy Agency is in charge of investigating 
Iraq's nuclear file. 
   British, French and Russian commissioners of UNSCOM took part in  
the Aziz-Butler talks, in response to Iraqi charges that the 
Commission is dominated by the United States. 
   The talks were the first between Butler, dubbed a "mad dog" in  
Iraq's press, and Aziz since a crisis over UNSCOM inspections began 
in late October. 
   Since UNSCOM resumed inspections on November after Iraq dropped  
a three-week ban on US members, it has carried out a total of 370 
inspections on a daily basis, according to Baghdad. 
   The inspections have been incident-free, but the arms experts  
have steered clear of the sensitive sites.
