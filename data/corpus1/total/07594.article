as thousands of people defiantly reclaimed Atlanta's Olympic 
Centennial Park Tuesday, three days after a deadly bomb blast 
there bloodied the Games. 
	 But a new dope scandal and a political defection cast  
further clouds over a Games seeking redemption after the terror 
of the bomb and a series of embarrassing blunders by local 
organisers. 
	 Jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis played a haunting refrain at  
a brief but poignant opening ceremony at the park before Andrew 
Young, a former aide of Martin Luther King, led a stirring 
service for the two dead and 110 injured. 
	 ``We're here not to wallow in tragedy but to enjoy a triumph  
of the human spirit,'' Young, an ordained preacher who co-chairs 
the Games' organising committee, told the cheering crowd. 
	 The uplifting service followed a compelling night of track  
and field drama in which American hero Carl Lewis claimed a 
special place in Olympic history. 
	 Lewis, 35, soared 8.50 metres to win his fourth successive  
Olympic long jump title and his ninth gold in a glittering 
career -- both record-equalling feats. 
	 But another setback hit the ill-starred sports extravaganza  
even as the park reopened. Officials announced Russian swimmer 
Nina Zhivanevskaya had been thrown out of the Games after 
failing a dope test. 
	 Zihvanevskaya, who finished eighth in the 200 metres  
backstroke final last week, tested positive for the 
stimulant-cum-masking agent bromantan. It was the fourth doping 
case reported at the Games and the third involving Russians. 
	 Russian swimmer Andrei Korneyev was stripped of his men's  
200 metres breaststroke bronze after testing positive for 
bromantan. Russia have appealed against his disqualification. 
	 A Cuban boxing coach on loan to the Mexican Olympic team  
defected and is seeking political asylum in the United States. 
	 Coach Mariano Leyva told a news conference in Miami Beach  
that he left Atlanta because he feared reprisals from Cuban 
security forces accompanying their island's Olympic team. 
	 Leyva was the fourth Cuban to defect in a month. Three  
athletes sought asylum in the United States before the Games. 
	 The Centennial Park entertainment area was the heart and  
soul of the Olympics before a crude pipe bomb attack at a 
crowded rock concert early Saturday. 
	 Thousands filed quietly into the park through tightly  
controlled checkpoints as it reopened Tuesday morning. 
	 Security measures have been redoubled at the previously  
lightly policed park. Police, soldiers, plain clothes officers 
and explosives-sniffing dogs patrolled and bags were searched. 
	 Bunches of flowers -- mostly red, white and blue carnations  
-- marked the spot where the bomb exploded, showering the 
revellers in shrapnel of nails and screws. 
	 As the gospel choir sang, the park's main attraction, a  
fountain in the form of the five Olympic rings, sprung back to 
life and seemed to dance to the tune. Children shrieked with 
delight as they dashed into the spray. 
	 A poll Tuesday showed Americans are overwhelmingly confident  
that the authorities will find those responsible. 
	 The FBI made right-wing militias the focus of its hunt for  
the Olympics bomber on Tuesday as the people of Atlanta 
celebrated the reopening of the Games park hit by the fatal 
blast. 
	 With the crude nature of the bomb pointing at American  
extremists rather than foreign guerrillas, newspapers reported 
that agents had questioned three American men -- at least one of 
whom was a member of an Alabama militia group called the Gadsden 
Minutemen. 
	 The newspapers said 24-year-old Derek Underwood, from  
Pinson, Alabama, had apparently provided a satisfactory alibi 
for the night of the bombing. 
	 ``It was a crime. I am against committing crimes,''  
Underwood told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 
	 FBI agents leading the operation declined to comment on the  
newspaper reports. 
	 FBI agents said on Tuesday they were sifting through  
mountains of evidence supplied by witnesses and were confident 
of success. 
	 Police meanwhile fended off criticism that they bungled the  
handling of an emergency call received minutes before the bomb 
sent a hail of shrapnel scything through a late-night crowd of 
rock fans in the Olympic park's main entertainment area. 
	 The Atlanta police department denied reports that it sat for  
10 minutes on the emergency 911 call, which agents believe may 
have been made by the bomber. 
	 ``We treated the call according to the set protocol,'' said  
police chief Beverly Harvard. 
	 NBC News television said it had heard from three reliable  
sources that a delay had been caused by technical glitches, 
possibly contributing to a higher casualty count. 
	 Two people died and 110 were injured in the blast.  
Munitions experts said accounts of the explosion suggested the 
use of the black gunpowder, easily obtainable in local sports 
stores. 
	 They said this also supported the theory that the attack was  
probably the work of American extremists rather than foreign 
guerrillas. 
	 Three members of a Georgia militia group were arrested in  
April for conspiring to make pipe bombs and planning an armed 
campaign against targets including federal office buildings, 
bridges and communications towers. 
	 Initial press reports said the Georgia group was planning an  
attack on the Olympics but agents investigating the case 
discounted this.
