four men arrested in connection with the rape last week of five 
U.S. college students to be held in jail pending trial. 
	 ``Since there is evidence linking him to the case, I ordered  
preventive detention,'' Judge Salvador Molina, of the Escuintla 
district court 40 miles south of the capital, told Reuters after 
a hearing in the case. 
	 Molina said the suspect, Cosbi Urias, refused to enter a  
plea and cannot be formally charged until he does. Three other 
suspects in custody have yet to be transferred to Molina's 
court. 
	 Guatemalan authorities are under intense pressure to produce  
results in the investigation of last Friday's rape of five 
women, aged 18 to 20, from St. Mary's College of Maryland. 
	 An armed gang of seven men hijacked a rented bus carrying 13  
students and three faculty members, robbing them and raping five 
women, on a major highway in southern Guatemala in broad 
daylight. 
	 The attack stunned officials at St. Mary's, who said they  
would reconsider future student trips to Guatemala, and drew a 
sympathetic comment from President Clinton. 
	 Guatemala's ambassador to the United States traveled to the  
college in southern Maryland Tuesday to express his regrets to 
students and administrators. 
	 ``At this time we are going to concentrate all our efforts  
in assisting in the healing of the victims in as many ways as 
possible,'' Ambassador Pedro Lamport told reporters at the 
college in St. Mary's City, Maryland. 
	 He said it was ``logical'' for the State Department to issue  
travel warnings about crime in Guatemala, but added: 
''Nevertheless, we do believe that in some areas there may be 
some exaggeration'' of the crime threat. 
	 Diplomats in Guatemala told Reuters the swift action so far  
in this case was a good sign. They complained that assaults 
against tourists routinely go without investigations, arrests or 
convictions. 
	 Police arrested Urias Friday, his brother-in-law Reyes  
Ventura Sunday and former soldiers Pablo and Pedro Xotoy Calel 
Monday. 
	 In early reports from the government, the name Xotoy was  
spelled Sotoy. 
	 Ventura and the Xotoys were in prison in Guatemala City, but  
Molina said they would have to come to his court in Escuintla 
some time this week to enter pleas in the case. 
	 National Police Chief Angel Conte, under fire for allegedly  
withholding information on the case over the weekend, defended 
his actions to reporters Tuesday. 
	 ``I can't give out details at this time because I don't want  
to hinder my investigation,'' Conte said.
