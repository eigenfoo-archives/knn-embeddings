	 LEIPZIG, Germany, May 1 (Reuter) - Thousands of Germans  
demonstrated across the country on Thursday at May Day rallies 
protesting against record post-war unemployment and rising 
right-wing extremism as neo-Nazis went on the rampage. 
	 Hundreds of neo-Nazis and dozens of left-wing extremists  
smashed windows and stormed through the northern town of 
Muenden, where right-wing extremists organised an illegal rally 
after authorities banned a march in Leipzig. 
	 Union demonstrators in Leipzig, Hamburg and Berlin waved  
union flags, shouted slogans and carried banners blaming 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl for Germany's post-war record 
unemployment -- at 4.5 million in March. 
	 Politicians, church and union leaders told the biggest rally  
of around 20,000 demonstrators in Leipzig that mass unemployment 
was the greatest challenge facing Germany and warned that it was 
sparking a rise in right-wing extremism. 
	 ``Conflict, hate and violence threaten our lives,'' Pastor  
Christian Fuehrer told a morning prayer meeting in the 
Nikolaikirche, the 12th century church that cradled the East 
German revolution which led to unification in 1990. 
 ``The young are dissatisfied with their lives in our country...  
In their disappointment they are open to dangerous words, the 
ideology of violence and the great promises of charlatans,'' 
Fuehrer said. 
	 The church service sheet depicted the mythical Pied Piper  
figure, who charmed children with his music, leading people out 
of the town carrying a banner reading ``Foreigners Out!'' 
	 Police in Muenden said they had detained 150 people in  
clashes between police and right-wing and left-wing extremists 
and one police officer had been hurt by a flying bottle. 
	 Police, who had been bracing for trouble in Leipzig and  
Berlin, were taken by surprise by the trouble in the picturesque 
tourist resort of Muenden, taking half an hour to mobilise 
sufficient forces to bring the clashes under control. 
	 Around 150 left-wing extremists in Leipzig hurled rocks and  
fireworks at police, who were trying to keep them apart from a 
small group of skinheads defying the ban of the rally there. 
	 Union members were expected to form a human chain around the  
centre of Leipzig to symbolise protecting the town from rising 
right-wing extremism. 
	 Klaus Zwickel, head of Germany's largest union IG Metall,  
told demonstrators in Leipzig it was time for Kohl to go because 
he had not tackled the problem of mass unemployment. 
	 ``This government is only interested in maintaining power.  
This government must be dissolved,'' Zwickel said. 
	 Oskar Lafontaine, leader of the opposition Social Democrats  
(SPD), called for a renewal of the political and social system. 
	 ``Share values are rising, profits are exploding and yet  
unemployment had been rising for years. We need new commercial 
and financial policies,'' Lafontaine told the crowd. 
	 He said the current obsession in the country with share  
values was ``the latest fashion from the United States'' and said 
workers should not allow it to continue. 
	 German Trade Union Federation chief Dieter Schulte agreed.  
	 ``They (politicians) must make sure our welfare state does  
not become a victim of market radicalism,'' he told a rally in 
Hamburg.
