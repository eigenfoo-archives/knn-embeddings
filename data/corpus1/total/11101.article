and identify up to 125 bodies from a hijacked Ethiopian Airlines 
plane that crashed into the Indian Ocean off the Comoro Islands 
began to unravel Monday, eyewitnesses said. 
	 At a makeshift morgue one nurse and an exhausted Ethiopian  
Airlines doctor labored to arrange dozens of bodies, injecting 
them with formol as a form of basic embalming. 
	 Up to 36 bodies -- putrifying after more than two days in  
the hot sun -- are trapped inside a section of the Boeing 767 
dragged onto a beach less than 50 yards from the restaurant of a 
local five-star hotel. 
	 American and Israeli officials who came to the Indian Ocean  
archipelago to identify and retrieve bodies of their citizens 
started to squabble with Comoron officials over the handling of 
the bodies in the morgue. 
	 A Kenyan and an Indian citizen on the island to look for  
relatives were forced to open up and look through more than 80 
body bags at the morgue. 
	 Witnesses said it appeared the well-meaning but makeshift  
operation had started to unravel because the Comoro Islands did 
not have the capacity to deal with such a disaster. 
	 The hijacked Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed and ditched  
into the sea after it ran out of fuel 500 yards off the beach 
Saturday. 
	 Rescuers winched a section of the plane onto a nearby beach  
Monday in an effort to free bodies still buckled into seats. 
	 In Addis Ababa, Ethiopian Airlines officials said the  
presumed death toll from the tragedy had risen to 125 after two 
people who survived the crash died of their injuries. 
	 The plane was hijacked by three men, believed to be  
Ethiopians, while en route to Nairobi, Kenya, and West Africa 
>from  Addis Ababa. 
	 Fifty of the 175 passengers and crew, including two of the  
suspected hijackers, are now believed to have survived. 
	 The United States Embassy in Addis Ababa condemned what it  
called the ``criminal and terrorist act'' and said the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation would enter the investigation because 
U.S. citizens had been on the flight. 
	 Franklin Huddle, U.S. consul general in Bombay, India, and  
his wife were among the survivors. 
	 Ethiopian Airlines, Africa's flag-ship carrier, made  
preparations Monday for a mass repatriation of the victims to 
the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa, but their efforts were 
hindered by a lack of coffins on the Muslim island-chain. 
	 ``The problem we have is that we have no coffins in the  
Comoros. We are a Muslim country. Possibly Ethiopian Airlines 
may bring some in,'' the Commander of Comoran police, Ismael 
Mognidaho, told Reuters. 
	 Muslims bury their dead in shrouds instead of coffins.  
	 Mognidaho said the authorities of the islands, lying in the  
Indian Ocean 190 miles east of the African mainland, had no 
problem in principle with a mass repatriation. 
	 Airline officials believe it will be easier for relatives to  
go to the Ethiopian capital than to the Comoros to identify 
their kin and make arrangements for the bodies. 
	 A special plane to transport the victims was not expected to  
arrive in the Comoros until Wednesday. 
	 India's honorary consul in the Comoros asked if Hindus could  
be cremated immediately, in line with their religion, but the 
request was turned down. In Islam cremation is not allowed. 
	 Lia Belai, the public relations head of the airline, said  
that after proper identifications and prayer services in Addis 
Ababa, the bodies would be transported to their respective 
destinations accompanied by airline officials. 
	 She said the airline would make arrangements for those who  
wished to take the body of a relative direct from the Comoros. 
	 Of the 163 passengers and 12 crew on board the plane, 145  
were international travelers from some 35 countries and 30 were 
Ethiopians. 
	 The bodies that have been found are being kept in a  
makeshift morgue in what used to be the cold storage facilities 
of a meat importer. By early Monday only two families had 
arrived on the island to try to identify relatives. 
	 Ethiopian Airlines said it would not be issuing a passenger  
list ``until proper identifications were carried out and the 
next of kin was informed,'' Lia said. 
	 Ethiopia has declared a three-day mourning period starting  
Monday and flags are flying at half-mast and asked the 
government of Comoro Islands to extradite the two hijackers who 
survived. 
	 The national radio played solemn music and the Ethiopian  
Orthodox Church said it would hold a requiem mass Tuesday for 
all those who died in the crash. 
	 Airline sources said a team of 18 Israelis had identified  
the bodies of three countrymen, but a dispute with the Comoron 
authorities had prevented them leaving the islands. 
	 The authorities say they were only allowed into the country  
on condition they remained and helped identify non-Israeli 
victims. A team from South Africa was denied entry permission. 
No official explanation was available. 
	 The Comoran police were using hacksaws and anything else  
that came to hand to break into the wreck. They pulled out one 
more body Monday morning, that of a woman in shorts still 
clutching a small, black rucksack.
