Japan with nuclear missiles in a major step to repair uneasy 
relations with Tokyo ahead of a three-day summit of 
industrialized nations. 
	 The ``goodwill gesture'' came during a meeting between  
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Japanese Prime Minister 
Ryutaro Hashimoto. Yeltsin also said it was time for Russia to 
''de-target'' missiles aimed at China. 
	 Removal of China and Japan from the list of Russian nuclear  
missile targets would be simply a gesture since Moscow could 
quickly retarget the missiles if it wanted. 
	 But it was another sign that the last vestiges of the Cold  
War were being dismantled. It came as leaders of the Group of 
Seven nations -- the United States, Japan, Canada, Italy, 
Germany, France and Britain, plus Russia, were to begin their 
annual summit with a working dinner on Friday night. 
	 Yeltsin, on a drive for greater respect for Russia's  
economy, received the good news in Denver that it had officially 
joined the ranks of creditor nations. 
	 Russia was made a member of the Paris Club, a grouping of  
government creditors who meet to discuss requests to renegotiate 
countries' debt. 
	 ``I just received some good news, so I'm in a good mood,''  
Yeltsin said. 
	 Russia, which inherited both the debts and the liabilities  
of the former Soviet Union, has won a series of deals to 
reschedule its own multi-billion dollar debts. But Moscow also 
lent large sums of money, mostly to Soviet-era allies in the 
developing world, and officials now see Paris Club membership as 
a way to get some of that money back. 
	 ``What you see here is a sweeping integration of Russia into  
the major decision-making networks of the world in a way that is 
very positive for the rest of us,'' President Bill Clinton said. 
	 Yeltsin reveled in his successes. He blew kisses to a small  
crowd as he headed for his talks with Clinton and briefly 
stopped to shake hands with a waiting crowd after the talks. 
	 ``Denver is good,'' he said, smiling broadly and giving the  
''thmbs up'' as the crowd chanted ``Yeltsin, Yeltsin.'' 
	 A Japanese spokesman said Yeltsin's pledge to stop targeting  
Japan with missiles was coupled with an agreement that the two 
countries should hold regular summit meetings and establish 
telephone hotlines. 
	 ``The president told the premier that there are former  
Soviet missles still targeted at Japan, and the time has come to 
take Japan off the targets,'' the spokesman said. 
	 At the start of his meeting with Hashimoto, Yeltsin told  
him, ``I am disappointed by the level of relations.'' 
	 The two leaders agreed to a new initiative proposed by Japan  
to expand Tokyo's investment in Russia. 
	 Japan was insistent in its decades-old demand for Russia to  
hand over four north Pacific islands seized by the Red Army at 
the end of the Second World War, a difficult step for Yeltsin 
because of strong nationalist opposition in Russia. 
	 ``Japan wants to normalize relations with Russia fully,'' a  
Japanese spokesman said. But he added, ``It will take some time 
to conclude this issue.'' 
	 Yeltsin was doing his characteristic best to put his stamp  
on the summit after missing last year's annual gathering in 
France because of severe heart problems. 
	 He came to Denver voicing hope that Russia would become a  
fully fledged member of the G7 club, but the goal appeared to be 
elusive. 
	 Hashimoto said Thursday he would seek assurances from other  
G7 leaders that Russia would continue to be excluded from the 
group's meetings on financial and macro-economic matters. 
	 Yeltsin is excluded from only one hour-long economic meeting  
Saturday. 
	 A Japanese spokesman said Russia was not yet ready yet to  
join the G7, adding: ``It will probably take some time for full 
integration of Russia into the international financial system.'' 
	 The United States has sidestepped the issue by calling  this  
meeting the ``Summit of the Eight'' but has made no promises to 
Yeltsin about ultimate inclusion in the exclusive club. 
	 Yeltsin and Clinton met to discuss European security issues,  
arms control and Russia's integration into the global economy. 
	 The U.S. president was also holding separate talks with  
French President Jacques Chirac and Italian Prime Minister 
Romano Prodi during the day.
