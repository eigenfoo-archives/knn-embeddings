scale dispute Tuesday over a visit by British Foreign Secretary 
Robin Cook to the construction site of Israel's most 
controversial new Jewish settlement. 
	 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said he had cut  
short a meeting with Cook and canceled a joint dinner after Cook 
surveyed the site of Har Homa on the edge of Arab East Jerusalem 
with a Palestinian legislator. 
	 Israel said Cook had broken a promise to see the site on  
agreed terms by meeting the lawmaker, Salah al-Ta'mari. 
	 ``I would expect from such a person who wants to help  
advance agreements that he himself will abide by his own 
agreements,'' Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai told reporters. 
	 Cook said that while he had agreed not to be briefed by  
Palestinian officials at the site, he made no promise to shun 
Palestinians during his visit to Har Homa. 
	 ``We repeatedly bent over backwards to accommodate their  
concerns,'' he told reporters after hour-long talks with 
Netanyahu which he said were amicable. ``We stuck very clearly 
to the agreement that we made.'' 
	 ``I'm not sorry to have lost a dinner. I've had three  
four-course meals already since I came to the Middle East. It is 
something of a mercy to be spared of a further full meal.'' 
	 Cook said he did not view the dispute as a crisis between  
the two countries. Other British officials responded angrily to 
the Israeli snub, with one calling it a ``fantastic 
overreaction.'' 
	 ``This is an extreme reaction and does not bode very well  
for the future. The Israelis appear to be in an ugly and 
insensitive mode,'' the official said. 
	 Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, who had earlier praised  
Cook's intention to visit the settlement site when the two met 
in self-ruled Gaza, called Israel's measures a provocation. 
	 ``I'm sorry to say that this is abnormal and he (Netanyahu)  
is trying to make a big issue against Mr Cook. No doubt this is 
provocative action against Europe,'' Arafat told a group of 
visiting Egyptian reporters in Gaza. 
	 Cook, on his first Middle East tour as foreign secretary,  
had hoped to breathe new life into ailing Israeli-Palestinian 
peace talks, deadlocked since Israeli bulldozers broke ground on 
the hilltop site of Har Homa one year ago Wednesday. 
	 His visit to the site, known in Arabic as Jabal Abu Ghneim,  
was intended to signal British and European Union opposition to 
continued Jewish settlement expansion on occupied land as an 
obstacle to advancing peace moves. 
	 But Cook's brief meeting with Ta'mari, amid scenes of mayhem  
as reporters and raucous right-wing Jewish protesters jostled 
around him, appeared to diminish any chance that Israel would 
meet Cook's hopes of a bigger EU role in peacemaking. 
	 Netanyahu said Cook had vowed not to meet Palestinian  
officials at the site. 
	 ``This, to my regret, was not honored. Our security people  
were totally surprised by the changes in the plan and hence the 
understandings as we understood them were not honored,'' 
Netanyahu told reporters. He pledged that thousands of homes 
would be built at Har Homa. 
	 Cook had been due to see the site with Faisal al-Husseini,  
the top PLO official in Jerusalem, but backed off after furious 
Israeli protests ahead of his arrival and instead was 
accompanied by Ta'mari. 
	 He was briefed by Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh at  
the site. 
	 In a pointed snub, Israeli police said they did not give  
Cook's motorcade an official escort while he visited the site. 
	 Israel captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East War  
and later annexed it in a move not recognized internationally. 
	 It regards the entire city as its sovereign territory and  
``united, eternal'' capital, while Palestinians want East 
Jerusalem as the capital of a future state. 
	 Cook was met by a torrent of abuse from right-wing Jews at  
the foot of Har Homa after crossing an Israeli army checkpoint 
into West Bank territory under Palestinian civilian control. 
	 Shielded from driving rain by an umbrella bearing Britain's  
logo for its EU presidency, Cook's chaotic stop lasted little 
more than 10 minutes and was accompanied throughout by yells of 
``Robin Go Home!'' and ``Death to Palestine!.'' 
	 ``Cook is an anti-Semite. He is a Jew-hater. He came here to  
stab a knife in the back of Israel,'' Noam Federman, a supporter 
of the outlawed anti-Arab Kach movement, told reporters.
