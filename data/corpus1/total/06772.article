Sunday examined the twisted remains of a Delta Air Lines jet 
engine, trying to determine why it blew apart on an airport 
runway, killing two people. 
	 A team from the National Transportation Safety Board spent  
the night looking at the damaged engine and reviewing Delta's 
maintenance records for the eight-year-old MD-88. 
	 George Black of the NTSB said it was too early to theorize  
why the engine blew up, but said he hoped to have more 
information at an evening news conference. 
	 ``It can be a violent event when one goes,'' Black told  
reporters, likening the rapid rotation of the engine's blades 
to ``swinging keys around.'' 
	 The accident occurred as Delta Flight 1288 was on the runway  
at Pensacola Regional Airport and preparing to take off for 
Atlanta. The airplane screeched to a halt about 1,500 feet 
down the runway after passengers heard a loud noise from the 
left engine, saw metal fragments slice through the fuselage and 
smelled smoke in the cabin. 
	 The two victims were identified as Anita and Nolan Saxton of  
Scottville, Michigan, who were seated in the rear of the 
aircraft. Saxton and her son died almost immediately. 
	 Of the five passengers injured, three were hospitalized  
Sunday. Two had minor injuries and the third was in serious 
condition with a broken leg. 
	 A spokesman for engine manufacturer Pratt & Whitney told the  
Atlanta Journal-Constitution that a fan blade may have failed in 
the front of the engine. 
	 ``We believe that is what happened. But we have not  
confirmed it because we haven't examined the engine,'' the 
newspaper quoted the spokesman as saying. 
	 Delta officials have refused to describe the accident as an  
explosion, preferring instead an engine ``disintegration.'' 
	 ``A jet engine, by its very nature, has many rapidly moving  
parts. And when those engines are built, they are designed with 
the expectation that there can be a failure of those parts,'' 
Delta spokesman Bill Berry told reporters Sunday. 
	 Pratt & Whitney confirmed to Delta that there had never  
before been an uncontained failure of a Delta JT8D-219 engine 
type, Berry said. He also noted that the airline's recent 
cost-cutting efforts had not affected maintenance procedures. 
	 The damaged engine had been overhauled late last year and  
was installed on the MD-88 in January. The engine had logged 
1,528 hours of service since then, Berry said. 
	 The same type of Pratt & Whitney engine, known as the  
JT8D-219 series, is used by many Boeing 727s and 737s, and Berry 
described it as ``a workhorse engine that has been around for 
many, many years.'' 
	 Delta has about 120 MD-88s in its fleet of more than 500  
aircraft. 
	 In a separate incident, a TWA flight headed for St. Louis  
>from  Seattle was forced to land on Saturday morning at Omaha's 
Eppley Airport due to an engine problem, airport officials said. 
	 The twin-engine MD-80 plane, which is an earlier model of  
the MD-88, lost power in one engine, but landed without 
incident, airport supervisor John Kennedy said. None of the 125 
passengers and crew were injured. 
	 ``I talked to the pilot and he said the engine just quit on  
him,'' Kennedy said. There were no signs of fire or explosion.
