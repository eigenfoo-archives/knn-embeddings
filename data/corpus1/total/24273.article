French truckers' strike Wednesday, threatening new efforts to 
end a gridlock that has paralyzed France and infuriated its 
European partners. 
	 But the atmosphere at the negotiating table was hopeful.  
	 ``This time, it looks like the bosses have finally  
understood what is happening at the roadblocks,'' Roger Poletti 
of the trade union Force Ouvriere (FO) told reporters after the 
first, 90-minute round of talks. 
	 ``The whole tone is now rather positive,'' said Joel Le Coq  
of the CFDT union. 
	 But Le Coq warned that the mood could sour if strikers came  
under attack from truckers seeking to break through the their 
roadblocks. 
	 Violence erupted early Wednesday when a dozen masked men  
charged a strikers' roadblock near Marseille, beating three 
truckers with iron bars and forcing an opening for about 12 
refrigerator trucks. 
	 One striker was rushed to the hospital with serious head  
injuries from the attack at Vitrolles in southern France. 
	 The union leaders and their negotiating partners of France's  
haulers associations returned to talks at about 4 p.m. after a 
lunch break of about four hours. 
	 Traffic officials counted 174 roadblocks, with Normandy, the  
Marseille area and the Rhone Valley worst hit. 
	 Gasoline shortages and hoarding of foodstuffs were reported  
around the country. 
	 While France's trading partners were concerned with gaining  
unimpeded access to markets through France, Paris stressed the 
right to strike. 
	 Spain says some 8,000 Spanish trucks have been delayed,  
trapped by roadblocks or forced to take alternative routes and 
Spanish farmers have threatened a boycott of French goods if the 
strike continues. 
	 An estimated 350,000 French truckers are involved in the  
strike in which the unions want an hourly wage for drivers, who 
say they often put in long days on the road without getting 
fully paid for them. The employers prefer a yearly or monthly 
salary. 
	 The French branch of computer modem maker U.S. Robotics, a  
unit of 3Com Corp., chartered a helicopter to bypass truckers' 
roadblocks at the Belgian border, company sources said. 
	 The helicopter loaded goods in the northern town of Lesquin,  
flew over roadblocks and unloaded them in the Belgian town of 
Miscron 10 miles away to be placed on Belgian trucks. 
	 Company sources said some customers in Europe had threatened  
to cancel contracts if goods were not delivered on schedule.
