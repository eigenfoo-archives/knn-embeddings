pilgrims died and 800 were injured Tuesday when a blaze ripped 
through 70,000 tents at a temporary compound near the Islamic 
holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia, official Saudi news media 
reported. 
	 Fire raged through tents at the plain of Mena, about seven  
miles from Mecca, where some two million Muslims from 100 
countries were gathering at the start of the centuries-old 
pilgrimage or haj, the media said. 
	 The cause of the fire was not immediately known, but  
residents said civil defense officials blamed the blaze on a gas 
explosion, probably caused by pilgrims cooking on gas stoves. 
	 Witnesses said the wailing sirens of ambulances could be  
heard across the plain as they rushed the injured to the 
hospital. They said the majority of those killed were 
Pakistanis, Indians and Bangladeshis. 
	 Saudi television showed fleets of fire engines speeding to  
the scene. Helicopters sprayed the area to extinguish the fire 
as black clouds filled the clear desert skies. 
	 Fierce flames, fueled by strong winds, licked the shells of  
burned-out tents as panic-stricken pilgrims rushed away from the 
devastation, dodging between rows of ambulances and yellow fire 
engines. 
	 A frail old man was carried away on a stretcher.  
	 Saudi security officers dragged away heavy gas cylinders.  
Diplomats said a gas explosion spawned the fire. Parts of the 
huge compound were completely flattened and littered with 
scorched debris. 
	 Muslims believe that those who die on the haj are assured of  
immediate entry to Paradise. 
	 Pakistani Ambassador Shahed Amin, who toured the site, told  
Reuters he saw tens of thousands of tents gutted by the flames. 
	 Saudi television said the blaze, which began at 11.45 a.m.  
and spread quickly in high winds, was extinguished by 3.05 p.m. 
	 Indian deputy chief of mission in Riyadh, George Joseph,  
said many families were separated while making their way to 
Mena, making it difficult to determine casualties. 
	 Bangladesh's consul general said at least one Bangladeshi  
had died in a stampede as crowds rushed to escape the flames. 
	 ``As far as we know all Bangladeshis are safe except for one  
person who died in a stampede,'' Mohsen Ali Khan said, adding 
there were some 35,000 Bangladeshi haj pilgrims. 
	 ``Our assessment is that the number of Indian dead runs into  
three figures,'' Indian Ambassador Mohammad Hamad Ansari told 
Reuters by telephone from Mecca. 
	 ``A good many tents were burned, including the Indian  
embassy control center, which was completely gutted. A lot of 
people are left without shelter among the Indian pilgrims,'' he 
said of the 80,000 Indians performing the haj this year. 
	 Ansari said he visited the tent city, parts of which had  
been razed to the ground. ``It's a traumatic experience for 
everyone who witnessed the fire, but there is a great deal of 
devotion among the pilgrims who continue to perform their 
prayers and haj rituals,'' he said. 
	 State-run Tehran Radio said the fire destroyed a number of  
Iranian pilgrims' tents, but said there were no casualties among 
its nationals. Iran has in recent years sent around 60,000 
pilgrims to the haj. 
	 The fatal blaze is the latest tragedy to strike Muslims on  
their pilgrimage to Mecca, their holiest shrine. Able-bodied 
Muslims are obliged to make the haj at least once if they can 
afford it. 
	 The worst of recent Mecca tragedies was a stampede in 1990  
in which 1,426 pilgrims were crushed to death in a tunnel. 
	 In 1994, 270 pilgrims were killed during a stampede at Mena  
outside Mecca, where pilgrims hurl stones at three piles of 
rocks symbolizing the devil. 
	 A chartered airliner carrying pilgrims home to Nigeria  
crashed after the 1991 haj, killing 261 people. 
	 In March 1991, a plane crash in northern Saudi Arabia killed  
91 Senegalese soldiers returning from a trip to Mecca which was 
a reward for their service in the U.S.-led coalition that had 
driven Iraqi forces from Kuwait in the Gulf War a month earlier. 
	 In 1989, bombs exploded near the Grand Mosque in Mecca,  
killing a pilgrim and wounding 16. Saudi Arabia beheaded 16 
Kuwaiti Shiites, including 10 of Iranian origin, after finding 
them guilty of planting the bombs. 
	 About 250 armed Sunni Muslim extremists took over the Grand  
Mosque in Mecca in November 1979. More than 100 of them and 127 
Saudi troops were killed in a two-week siege, which did not take 
place during the main pilgrimage season. 
    Last year Saudi Arabia said three people were killed when a  
gas fire swept through the tent camps in Mena. 
	 Some 400 people, mainly Iranian Shiite pilgrims, were killed  
in clashes with Saudi security forces during anti-Western 
protests in Mecca in 1987. 
	 Witnesses said the fire slowed down the movement of pilgrims  
>from  about 100 countries who began leaving Mecca Tuesday after 
dawn prayers at the Grand Mosque where they circled the Kaaba, a 
small building housing Islam's sacred black stone, seven times, 
the first haj ritual. 
	 Saudi Arabia, custodian of Islam's two holiest shrines, has  
spent $18.6 billion in the last decade on expanding sites in 
Mecca and surrounding areas. 
	 Saudi officials said they were doing their best to ensure a  
safe haj. They have urged the pilgrims to abide by security 
instructions, especially in usually congested areas. 
	 Cameras installed on main roads, bridges and tunnels monitor  
pilgrims' movements to ensure that the haj proceeds peacefully.
