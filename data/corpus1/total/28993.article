celebrations Monday took place under a pall cast by a massacre 
during the weekend of 23 Hindus in the disputed state of Jammu 
and Kashmir and killings in the insurgency-racked northeast. 
	 Police said 10 men, nine women and four children were killed  
by gunmen in a Hindu village outside Srinagar, the summer 
capital of Jammu and Kashmir, on Sunday night. 
	 The attackers shot dead most of the victims, torched a small  
Hindu temple and blew up a house, killing two or three people. 
	 The incident was the latest in a cycle of violence in the  
north-western state, where 1996 elections re-established a local 
government after nine years of direct rule from New Delhi. 
	 At least a dozen militant groups are fighting for Kashmir's  
independence or merger with neighboring Pakistan. Police say 
more than 20,000 people have been killed since the revolt in the 
Muslim-majority state began in 1990. 
	 In a statement issued in Jammu, the state's winter capital,  
provincial Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah blamed separatist 
guerrillas for the attack. 
	 ``It was a dastardly attack by militants who have no  
religion or respect for human values,'' the statement said. 
	 India, which controls two-thirds of Kashmir, accuses  
Pakistan of arming and training separatist guerrillas. Pakistan, 
which rules the rest of the state, denies the charge and says it 
only provides political and diplomatic support to the rebels. 
	 In the far-flung states of the northeast, eight people were  
killed and a railway station was burnt down over the weekend. 
	 They said a policeman and a guerrilla died in two separate  
clashes and the body of a non-tribal who had been kidnapped by 
tribals was found in Assam. 
	 In Manipur, the mountainous state close to Myanmar (Burma),  
at least five tribal guerrillas were killed by soldiers. 
	 The violence came ahead of nationwide celebrations on Monday  
to celebrate the country's 49th Republic Day. 
	 The nation's main parade in the capital, New Delhi, went  
ahead without a hitch. About 15,000 security personnel were 
mobilized for the elaborate display and its chief guest, French 
President Jacques Chirac, looked on from a bullet-proof stand. 
	 More than 25,000 people flocked to Raj Path, the tree-lined  
avenue that cuts a broad swathe through the heart of New Delhi, 
to watch a colorful show of India's military might, history and 
cultural diversity. 
	 Separatist guerrilla groups in the northeast called for a  
general strike to boycott the celebrations, ahead of which 
police had seized caches of arms, ammunition and explosives. 
	 ``We have decided to boycott the celebration because such an  
occasion is a moment of happiness for those who have violated 
our human rights, suppressed the right of self-determination of 
small nationalities and exploited our resources,'' said Arabinda 
Rajkhowa, head of the Maoist United Liberation Front of Assam. 
	 India's northeastern region, made up of seven states and  
home to over 200 ethnic tribes and groups, has been rocked by 
separatist violence since India won independence 50 years ago. 
	 The ethnic groups blame New Delhi for exploiting their rich  
mineral and forest resources, ignoring the regional economy and 
social welfare and flooding the region with non-tribals from 
neighbouring Bangladesh and other areas of India.
