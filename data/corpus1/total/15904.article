at the Zairian-Angolan border while Angolan and United Nations 
officials decide their fate, an Angolan minister said Sunday. 
	 ``I understand there could be as many as 17,000 of these  
refugees waiting to cross into Angola from Zaire, so we must 
deal with this situation,'' Albino Malungo, the Angolan Minister 
of Assistance and Social Reintegration, told Reuters. 
	 The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), quoting  
Zairian sources, said last month that some 30,000 Rwandan 
refugees were seen moving toward the Angolan border. 
	 Some of the refugees were reported to be former soldiers of  
the Hutu-dominated Rwandan government and Interhamwe militia, 
largely held responsible for the 1994 Rwandan genocide. 
	 Travel to the area has been severely restricted by the  
Angolan military and even personnel from the U.N.'s peacekeeping 
mission in Angola, UNAVEM, have been denied access to the area 
along the border near the city of Dundo. 
	 Malungo, the man charged with dealing with the refugees,  
said the Angolan government was working with the UNHCR to try to 
resolve the situation. 
	 ``We are currently working together with the UNHCR trying to  
bring the women and small children across the border,'' he said. 
``The others, all those who are armed, of course, will not be 
allowed into Angola.'' 
	 Earlier in the week Malungo told Reuters that many of the  
refugees camped across the border were armed. UNHCR officials in 
Luanda have declined to comment on the refugees, but the UNHCR 
in Geneva last month estimated the number at 7,000. 
	 Another 500 refugees have crossed into nearby territory held  
by UNITA, according to officials of the former rebel movement in 
Luanda. UNITA still controls vast areas of Angolan territory and 
almost all of the common land border between Zaire and Angola, 
except for a small strip around Dundo. 
	 Malungo said he would have a complete report on the refugees  
when a representative of his office returned to Luanda from the 
area Monday.
