and begun a slow fall in West Virginia and parts of Ohio, although high 
water is expected to linger in some areas for several days. 
	At least 26 deaths have been attributed to flooding across the Ohio  
River Valley but the final toll will likely rise as receding floodwaters 
reveal more bodies. 
	Forecasters predicted the Ohio would crest at about 15 feet over  
flood stage at Louisville, Ky., Friday night or Saturday. 
	Many people remain unaccounted for in riverside communities across  
four states. State emergency officials Thursday said 10 people were 
listed as missing in Falmouth, Ky., where overflow from the Licking 
River reached the rooftops of homes. Search dogs are helping crews look 
for possible victims. 
	National Weather Service hydrologist Mike Callahan has said flooding  
will probably persist in some areas well after the Ohio crests. 
	``Everything will stay submerged for several days,'' he said. ``The  
river is not going to be in a hurry to fall.'' 
	President Clinton has declared federal disasters due to flooding in  
Kentucky, Ohio and Indiana. Federal damage assessments are under way in 
West Virginia. 
	At Cincinnati, the Ohio River crested Wednesday night at 64.7 feet,  
12 feet above flood stage. Moving at about 5 mph, the river was filled 
with debris, including entire buildings and trees. Chemicals, pesticides 
and runoff from sewage treatment plants added to the flow. 
	Health experts say that even though the Ohio is receding, the danger  
is far from over. 
	Some 650 West Virginia National Guard troops have joined state police  
troopers and Red Cross workers in providing mass tetanus inoculations. 
	West Virginia Emergency Medical Services spokeswoman Penny Byrnside  
told UPI the inoculations were designed to limit health problems among 
the estimated 9,000 people affected by flooding in her state. 
	Elsewhere floodwaters surged Thursday over the Lake Livingston dam in  
southeast Texas, and authorities called for voluntary evacuation of low- 
lying areas along the Trinity River.
