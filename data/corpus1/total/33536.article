filled St. Peter's Square to celebrate Easter with Pope John Paul II. 
	The pope -- sitting at an alter surrounded by a multifarious ocean of  
flora given to the Vatican by Dutch flower-growers -- said prayers to 
commemorate the day Christians believe Jesus Christ rose from his tomb 
after being crucified by the Romans outside the walls of Jerusalem 
almost 2000 years ago. 
	The 77-year-old pontiff, visibly fatigued by his busy Holy Week  
schedule, conducted today's 2-hour 15-minute Easter mass in front of the 
immense Baroque basilica, whose facade was hidden under scaffolding. 
John Paul II said prayers with the crush of devoted Catholics who had 
converged upon the Eternal City this week to observe the Church's 
holiest celebration. 
	From the High Altar the Polish pontiff said the world still bears the  
cross and called for an end to ethnic violence. The pope referred to the 
Hutu and Tutsi bloodshed in western Africa and a nascent conflict 
between ethnic Albanians and Serbs in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo. 
	John Paul II told the crowd in St. Peter's Square, ``This  
proclamation for peace is for all those who are undergoing a cavalry 
seemingly without end, thwarted in their aspiration for respect for 
dignity and human rights, for justice, for employment, and for fairer 
living conditions.'' 
	The pope said, ``May this proclamation be an inspiration to the  
leaders of nations...especially in the Middle East and particularly in 
Jerusalem where peace is at risk by dangerous political decisions,'' 
intimating to the Holy Land leaders Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin 
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yassar Arafat. 
	Before returning to his residence, the pope greeted the world in 58  
languages, saying, ``In the joy of Jesus Savior of the world, Happy 
Easter!''
