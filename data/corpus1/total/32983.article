sentenced to 10 years in prison on war crimes charges Thursday 
as a court found him guilty of rounding up Jews for deportation 
to Nazi death camps. 
	 The jury, rendering its verdict after more than 18 hours of  
deliberation, found Papon, 87, guilty of complicity in crimes 
against humanity but not responsible for his victims' murder. 
Most of those deported never returned. 
	 The white-haired Papon, a senior official in the  
collaborationist Vichy government, sat motionless, his chin in 
his hand. He showed no emotion as the verdict by the jury of 
three judges and nine civilians was announced. 
	 Civil parties and Jewish organizations expressed their  
disappointment that Papon was not give life in prison. Papon's 
lawyers said they would appeal the conviction up to the European 
Court of Human Rights. 
	 ``We are not satisfied by the sentence, but we are happy  
that justice has been done,'' said Alain Jakubowicz, a lawyer 
for Jewish organizations in the case against Papon. 
	 ``Maurice Papon deserved the exemplary punishment of life  
imprisonment,'' said Jean Kahn, head of the Central Israelite 
Consistory of France. ``We regret that it was not handed down.'' 
	 Israelis expressed limited satisfaction. ``It's a muted  
victory and a sad day because the millions of innocent people 
who were killed can never be brought back,'' said Shevach Weiss, 
Israel's deputy parliament speaker and a survivor of the 
Holocaust. 
	 Visibly exhausted after the six months of court proceedings  
and their all-night vigil, civil parties whose relatives died in 
death camps choked back sobs and hugged each other when the 
verdict was announced. 
	 The jury found Papon guilty of helping to organize four of  
the eight convoys of Jews sent off from the Drancy internment 
camp near Paris on their way to the concentration camps. Papon 
denied knowing of the Holocaust at the time. 
	 Many tried to hide their disappointment that Papon did not  
get a life sentence, which is the legal norm for crimes against 
humanity. 
	 But Michel Slitinsky, a civil plaintiff who narrowly escaped  
deportation himself, said, ``For a man of such standing, a man 
with such a high idea of himself, you can't say this is 
nothing.'' 
	 Papon's counsel Jean-Marc Varaut, angrily branding the  
verdict ``neither fish nor fowl,'' said he would appeal to 
France's highest appeals court and as high as the European Court 
of Human Rights. 
	 ``I think the jury was afraid of something. I think they  
were afraid of the frustration of the civil plaintiffs,'' he 
said. 
	 Papon, who rose after the war to become Paris police chief  
and later budget minister, will not go to jail until his appeals 
are exhausted. That could take years. 
	 He went on trial Oct. 8 on charges of ordering the arrest  
for deportation of 1,560 Jews, 223 of them children, from  1942 
to 1944. Under the right-wing Vichy regime, which collaborated 
with the Nazis, Papon was then secretary-general of the regional 
prefect's office and supervisor of its Service for Jewish 
Questions. 
	 The trial was the longest in French postwar history and  
forced the country to re-examine its role in the wartime Nazi 
occupation, which the French originally tried to play down while 
recalling the small but valiant resistance movement. 
	 ``The most important thing is that now young people will  
know. He will probably never serve a day in prison, but that's 
not important,'' said civil plaintiff Francoise Pasteur, who 
lost relatives in the Nazi death camps. 
	 ``He's been deprived of all his rights, he's a nonperson,  
and for me, that's enough.''
