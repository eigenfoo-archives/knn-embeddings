funeral for victims of the world's worst mid-air disaster while 
police said they were near the end of their search for the 
remains of the 349 people killed in the crash. 
	 As the sombre rites drew closer, stunned and weeping  
relatives were still trying to identify their loved ones, many 
of them charred and some mangled beyond recognition. 
	 ``The sky has eaten up my daughter,'' wailed the distraught  
mother of Saudi Airlines stewardess Maneesha Malhotra, who was 
on her last flight before resigning to enter a major Indian 
beauty pageant. 
	 ``We haven't even found anything that belongs to her.''  
	 Authorities said they had identified only 131 of 294 bodies  
recovered from the the wreckage of Tuesday's collision between a 
Saudi Arabia Airlines jumbo jet and a Kazakh cargo plane. 
	 A total of 349 passengers and crew, 312 on the Saudi Boeing  
747 jet and 37 on the Ilyushin Il-76 freighter, were killed in 
India's worst aviation disaster. 
	 ``We are hopeful of identifying more bodies,'' police  
superintendent Mohammad Akil said in Charkhi Dadri, where the 
planes fell to the ground, about 80 km (50 miles) west of Delhi. 
	 Senior policeman Mohinder Lal, in charge of search  
operations at the Saudi crash site, said he expected the work to 
be wrapped up by nightfall. 
	 ``We want to complete the operation of getting the bodies  
and belongings out by this evening,'' he told Reuters. 
	 The Saudi airliner and the incoming Kazakh plane collided  
seven minutes after the Saudi 747 had taken off from New Delhi 
at nightfall on Tuesday. 
	 Aviation experts said the cause of the crash could be known  
in the next two weeks. Indian officials denied that inadequate 
ground equipment or misunderstood instructions from the control 
tower were to blame. 
	 Akil said officials would meet Hindu and Moslem leaders to  
decide what to do with unidentifiable bodies and body parts. 
	 ``We will hold a meeting this afternoon and decide whether  
to cremate or bury,'' he said. Hindus cremate their dead while 
Moslems bury them. ``By today evening or tomorrow morning, we 
will dispose of the bodies,'' he said. 
	 Alimmuddin Asadi, of the Moslem Jamiat Ulema Hind religious  
organisation, said many victims were Moslem. ``We want their 
last rites to be done according to Islamic ways,'' he said. 
	 Jet Ram Gupta, district president of the hardline Hindu  
Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, said local officials would decide 
what to do with the bodies. ``We will not create any disputes,'' 
he said. 
	 Authorities have not yet released an official passenger list  
indicating nationalities. 
	 All 37 victims on the chartered KazAir plane, which was  
taking businessmen to Delhi to pick up goods, have been 
identified. A Saudi newspaper said the victims on the Saudi 
airliner included 215 Indians, 13 Saudis, and three Pakistanis. 
	 Nepal said there were 53 Nepalis on board, most of them  
headed for jobs as manual labourers, drivers and plumbers. There 
were three Americans and one Briton aboard, officials said. 
	 At least 60 bodies were mutilated beyond recognition after  
the Saudi airliner dug a deep crater in a mustard field when it 
crashed to the ground. 
	 Bodies were being kept on ice blocks in a nearby hospital.  
Horse-drawn carriages drew up with newly-made coffins. 
	 Mohinder Lal said two cranes were on their way to lift large  
chunks of the Saudi wreckage so searchers could look for bodies 
trapped in the debris. 
	 Speculation on the cause of the tragedy ranges from  
inadequate equipment at New Delhi airport to pilot 
misunderstanding of instructions from ground controllers. 
	 Yogesh Chandra, the top civil servant at India's Civil  
Aviation Ministry, ruled out both. He said the transcript of the 
final conversations between the pilots and ground control showed 
both understood their instructions. 
	 The transcript, which Chandra read to reporters, showed the  
pilots of both aircraft appeared to have understood instructions 
to maintain altitudes 1,000 feet apart. 
	 Chandra said speculation that ageing equipment at Delhi  
airport might be to blame was ``absolutely incorrect.'' 
	 But pilots said the government had dragged its feet in  
installing radar equipment that would have permitted air traffic 
controllers in Delhi to establish the altitude of both aircraft 
as well as their direction.
