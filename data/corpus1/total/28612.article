Maryland, stunned by the rape of five students on a study tour 
in Guatemala, said Monday administrators would have to 
reconsider future visits to the Central American nation. 
	 Thirteen of the 1,500 students who attend the 158-year-old  
liberal arts college and three faculty organizers were robbed at 
gunpoint Friday in a sugar-cane field along a deserted highway 
40 miles southwest of Guatemala City. 
	 The gunmen who forced their excursion bus off the road with  
a pickup truck were visibly disappointed to find that the 16 
Americans had spent most of their money after two weeks in the 
country. It was at that point, college officials said, that the 
bandits marched five women away and raped them. 
	 Some members of the tour were treated at Guatemala City  
Hospital. All were back in the United States by Sunday evening. 
	 ``It's very unfortunate that what was a mission of human  
interest and kindness was so bitterly turned around,'' St Mary's 
College President Jane Margaret O'Brien told a news conference. 
	 ``I'm absolutely sure we'll review all of our procedures and  
policies,'' she said. ``We may exclude this area, and we may 
look more broadly in our Latin American programs and determine 
how best we can serve the safety issue first before we do any of 
the cultural-enrichment activities for our students.'' 
	 The college, whose campus lies just northwest of Point  
Lookout on the Chesapeake Bay in southeastern Maryland, made 
counseling available round-the-clock to students who were on the 
trip. Officials said counselors were also ready to help other 
students. 
	 Spanish professor Jorge Rogachevsky, one of the faculty  
members who organized the trip, said the students in Guatemala 
had shown exceptional bravery during the attack. But he 
described the larger college community as experiencing ``a 
severe trauma.'' 
	 At a second news conference, the 43-year-old Argentine-born  
academic also spoke passionately about the need to preserve 
educational programs like the Guatemala study tour. 
	 ``Tragedy should not derail us from the need to reach out to  
the world community and to new understanding,'' he said. ``The 
worst kind of message we can derive from this is the sense that 
we have to insulate ourselves.'' 
	 Rogachevsky said he and his colleagues sought to avoid the  
well-known dangers of the Guatemalan countryside by traveling 
only in daylight and using local guides familiar with the area. 
The students and their tour leaders spent most of the time in 
the northern province of Peten, famous for its Mayan ruins and 
dense jungle terrain. 
	 The attack occurred after the group returned to Guatemala  
City and was heading toward a highland village in Guatemala's 
southwest. The trip was part of an education program organized 
by Cicdeca, a nongovernmental organization devoted to 
development projects in the highlands. 
	 ``It was the first time they'd been in the highlands for  
human rights study,'' O'Brien noted. 
	 Despite reports that the group had been stopped by four  
gunmen, Rogachevsky said there were five or more bandits -- four 
gunmen in the truck's bed and at least one other bandit behind 
the wheel. 
	 ``One of the things that kept going through my mind was, how  
will this end?'' he said, recalling a terrifying 90 minutes 
spent lying face down in the cane field as cars passed invisibly 
on the nearby highway. 
	 The ordeal ended when a unit of Guatemalan police showed  
up. ``I knew it was over when I heard shots and people said: 
'This is the police. Stand up,''' Rogachevsky said. 
	 The U.S. Embassy in Guatemala City said police had arrested  
two Guatemalan men suspected of taking part in the attack. 
	 Violent attacks and robberies against tourists are not  
uncommon in Guatemala, although the government tries to minimize 
the problem. The U.S. State Department warns visitors to 
Guatemala about highway robbery and armed assaults.
