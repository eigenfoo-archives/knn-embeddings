to be Ireland's next president, according to preliminary 
election results released Friday. 
	 Law professor McAleese was set to succeed Mary Robinson with  
some 45 percent support in the first count, 16 points ahead of 
opposition parliamentarian Mary Banotti. 
	 Banotti conceded defeat shortly before the first count  
figures were announced. 
	 ``I congratulate Mary McAleese on her victory,'' she told  
RTE, the national broadcasting network. 
	 McAleese was mobbed by supporters as she entered Dublin  
Castle to hear the first count results. 
	 Politicians said she had an unassailable lead but would have  
to await a second count later Friday to pick up the crucial 
extra support to confirm her victory. 
	 The second tally of Thursday's votes was expected to be  
announced by 9.30 p.m. (2130 GMT) Friday. 
	 Three other candidates were eliminated after the first count  
in the poll, organised under proportional representation. 
	 One of them, Dana, an independent who won the European Song  
Contest in 1970, shocked the political establishment by coming a 
strong third with 14 percent 
	 McAleese, 46, is a devout Roman Catholic and Irish  
nationalist who lives in British-ruled Northern Ireland. 
	 She will be the first Irish head of state born in the  
disputed British province, where the 60 per cent Protestant 
majority support rule from London and bitterly oppose the Irish 
constitution's claims to jurisdiction over the region. 
	 Northern Ireland residents are entitled to Irish  
citizenship. They have votes in British elections but not in 
Irish elections. 
	 The first count results mirrored pre-election surveys which  
had made McAleese the front-runner to succeed Robinson, who 
transformed the largely ceremonial job, previously a male 
preserve, into a high-profile crusading role. 
	 Robinson resigned short of completing a seven- year term in  
September to become United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights. 
	 McAleese was the candidate of the strongly nationalist  
ruling Fianna Fail party and its center-right coalition 
Progressive Democrat partner. 
	 Her campaign was embroiled in controversy when leaked  
documents portrayed her as a tacit supporter of Sinn Fein, the 
political arm of the outlawed Irish Republican Army. 
	 McAleese strenuously denied the claims, which her backers  
said were part of a dirty tricks campaign. 
	 Irish ministers rallied behind her, describing her as a  
bridge-builder in behind-the-scene efforts to end decades of 
Northern Ireland strife and promote reconciliation across a deep 
sectarian divide. 
	 Her candidature has provoked a mixed response among  
pro-British unionist politicians in the province. 
	 Dana, who campaigned for tradition family values, got twice  
the support of Adi Roche, the nominee of left-wing and green 
parties. Derek Nally, a retired police officer came last with 
under five percent.
