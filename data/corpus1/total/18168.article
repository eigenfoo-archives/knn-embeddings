Monday when police broke up protests by thousands of people, 
badly beating organizers of opposition-backed rallies and firing 
into the crowd. 
	 It was the most violent day of protests across this East  
African country since July 7, 1990 when 20 people were killed as 
a campaign for a switch to pluralist politics gathered pace. 
	 ``(President Daniel arap) Moi must go. Moi must go,''  
hundreds of stone-throwing supporters chanted as they marched 
into the deserted business center of Nairobi, pelting buses and 
cars. 
	 Moi, 73, however looks certain to extend his 19-year rule by  
five more years because of electoral rules and opposition 
splits. No date has been set for this year's general election. 
	 Riot police and elite paramilitary General Service Unit  
(GSU) officers fired teargas, rubber bullets and live rounds to 
break up rallies in Nairobi. Many protesters were severely 
beaten, some even after surrendering and offering no resistance. 
	 Police appeared to single out for particularly savage  
beatings leaders of opposition-backed groups which called the 
rallies to press for constitutional reforms before presidential 
and parliamentary elections. 
	 ``Kill him, kill him,'' bellowed police and council workmen  
with clubs as they laid into a man in the capital's Uhuru park. 
	 Police said Red Cross workers found a boy bleeding from his  
mouth and ears in Uhuru park but he died en route to the 
hospital. 
	 There was no accurate figure for casualties but scores of  
people were wounded. 
	 GSU and police fired teargas inside Nairobi's All Saint's  
Cathedral and beat demonstrators including Muturi Kigano, head 
of the unregistered Safina party, and opposition members of 
parliament Kamau Icharia and Njoka Mutahi, witnesses said. 
	 ``We were in the middle of the service when they broke in,  
fired teargas into the house of God. This is Kenyan justice for 
you. Even in God's house they beat innocent protesters,'' said 
the Rev. Peter Njoka. 
	 The Rev. Timothy Njoya, the moderator of the Presbyterian  
Church of East Africa and an organizer of the demonstrations, 
was severely beaten near the cathedral by six police wielding 
wooden pick-axe handles. His assistant was also bady hurt. 
	 In Thika, 20 miles from Nairobi, witnesses told Reuters that  
David Mutugi, 17, was shot in the chest and killed by police at 
Moi gardens, when police and prison guards charged people 
gathering for a demonstration. 
	 ``Mutugi was running with two other guys and the police shot  
him in the chest and he fell,'' said witness Moses Gachamba. 
Police said it was unknown if Mutugi was killed by police fire. 
	 Thika hospital sources said at least five other people were  
hospitalized after being injured, most by beating, when police 
stormed Moi gardens, which has a secondhand clothes market. 
	 Police spokesman Assistant Commissioner Peter Kimanthi said  
four men were killed in Nyahururu town, including two men 
crushed to death when a crowd stampeded as police moved in, and 
a man was shot dead and a boy died of his wounds in Nairobi. 
	 Kimanthi said the two men were crushed to death when 3,000  
people heading for the prison in Nyahururu, 60 miles west of 
Nairobi, was dispersed by police and prison officers. 
	 Two more men were shot by police in Nyahururu when a mob  
attempted to storm a bank and broke windows, he added. 
	 Kenyan newspaper journalists however said they had witness  
reports that all four men in Nyahururu were shot by police. 
	 In Uthiru, 10 miles northwest of Nairobi, youths set up  
roadblocks, set ablaze tires and stoned cars. Police escorted 
motorists into the city and fired teargas and live rounds. 
Youths there also dropped rocks on cars from a foot bridge. 
	 The town of Nakuru, northwest of Nairobi, was also closed  
down as members of Moi's ruling Kenya African National Union, 
wielding clubs, broke up demonstrations by hundreds of people. 
	 ``We have made our point,'' said Kenyan dissident Koigi wa  
Wamwere in Nakuru. ``Our idea was for people to stay home, for 
people to attend this rally. Our strategy is not for violence.''
