Mandela's ex-wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, doggedly denied 
charges of murder and assault Thursday, but ended a long day 
before South Africa's truth commission with an enigmatic 
apology. 
	 Archbishop Desmond Tutu, chairman of the statutory Truth and  
Reconciliation Commission (TRC), appealed to her repeatedly at 
the end of the nine-day inquiry to apologize. 
	 ``I beg you, I beg you, I beg you, please. You are a great  
person and you don't know how your greatness will be enhanced if 
you were to say: I am sorry,'' he said in a breaking voice. 
	 She conceded that her role in the struggle against apartheid  
had somehow gone wrong. 
	 ``I am saying it is true, things went horribly wrong. I  
fully agree with that. For that part of those painful years when 
things went horribly wrong and we were aware of the fact...for 
that I am deeply sorry,'' said Madikizela-Mandela, who often 
speaks of herself as ``we.'' 
	 In one of the more dramatic moments of the day the mother of  
a youth she is alleged to have killed or whose death she 
allegedly ordered hugged and kissed Madikizela-Mandela when Tutu 
called the parents of murdered children to step forward. 
	 A witness told officials members of Madikizela-Mandela's  
African National Congress (ANC) Women's League harassed the 
mother in the women's toilet during a tea break and Tutu said 
charges would be brought if the reports was substantiated. 
	 Madikizela-Mandela, 63, ended her marathon session on the  
witness stand with an angry allegation that the TRC had timed 
her public hearing to undermine her campaign to be elected 
deputy president of the ruling ANC. 
	 ``There are unhealthy coincidences that gather up and make  
me form this opinion,'' she said. 
	 TRC deputy chairman Alec Boraine denied the allegation and  
pointed out that she had asked for the public hearing. 
	 Though she had spent the day angrily denying any role in the  
murders of 14-year-old Stompie Seipei or popular township doctor 
Aby Baker Asvat, she said in response to Tutu's closing plea: 
	 ``I will take this opportunity to say to the family of Dr.  
Asvat how deeply sorry I am and to Stompie's mother...how deeply 
sorry I am.'' 
	 Responding for the first time to eight days of relentless  
testimony of assault, torture and murder by her and her Mandela 
United Football Club entourage, Madikizela-Mandela dismissed all 
the charges as ``ludicrous fabrications.'' 
	 She denied all of the six murders in which she had been  
implicated, including the charge that she killed Seipei in 
December 1988 or that she ordered him killed. 
	 Tutu intervened to break the rising tension after she had  
been in the witness chair for seven hours, inviting her accusers 
to step forward and be recognized. 
	 Amid cheers and gasps from spectators, Joyce Seipei, mother  
of Stompie, strode across the room to shake hands with 
Madikizela-Mandela and then leaned across the witness table to 
kiss and hug her. 
	 Others who had accused Madikizela-Mandela of a role in the  
deaths or torture of their loved ones gathered closer to Tutu. 
	 The kiss came after a clash between Madikizela-Mandela and  
lawyer Steven Kuny, who charged in an angry outburst, ``The 
truth in your hands is putty.'' 
	 She snapped back: ``That is a preposterous statement. I beg  
of you not to talk to me like that.'' 
	 During Thursday morning's proceedings, a witness told  
commission officials two members of Madikizela-Mandela's ANC 
Women's League had harassed Seipei in the women's toilet during 
a tea break. 
	 Tutu said officials would lay criminal charges if they could  
substantiate the report. 
	 ``I appeal: Please don't do it. That mother has lost a child  
who was killed brutally,'' he said. 
	 Madikizela-Mandela also condemned the incident, saying: ``We  
cannot believe that any mother, let alone a representative of 
the Women's League, would be involved in that kind of conduct.'' 
	 Madikizela-Mandela, divorced by Mandela last year on the  
grounds of infidelity, was convicted in 1990 of kidnapping 
Seipei and fined. She was acquitted of his murder. 
	 President Mandela told reporters during a visit to a home  
for the aged in Pretoria, ``I have supreme confidence in each 
and every one of the members of the TRC. Let us leave the matter 
to them.'' 
	 Jerry Richardson, head of Madikizela-Mandela's football club  
bodyguard, is currently serving a life sentence for the killing, 
which he described in graphic testimony Wednesday. 
	 He said he and an associate called Slash made the child lie  
on his back and then stabbed him through the throat with a pair 
of garden shears. 
	 Asked to respond to Richardson's claim that she ordered  
Seipei's murder, she said, ``That is ludicrous and the worst 
lunacy.'' 
	 ``None of these things took place whatsoever. For me to have  
to sit here and answer these allegations is a source of great 
pain to me,'' she added later. 
	 She also denied a role in Asvat's contract murder in his  
Soweto office, allegedly because he could incriminate her in 
Seipei's murder. 
	 Though the truth commission has no power to punish her, the  
evidence of the past nine days has shredded her political image 
and could have destroyed her chance of election later this month 
as deputy leader of the ruling ANC. 
	 She told the panel, which was established to heal the wounds  
of apartheid, that she did not control the actions of the youths 
who operated from her backyard. 
	 ``I did not have any direct control over these youths who  
came to seek refuge in my place... They led their own lives in 
the back and I had my own problems to deal with,'' she said. 
	 Wearing a black two-piece suit with green blouse and gold  
necklace, she said she regretted, but was not responsible for 
the deaths reported to the commission. 
	 ``Of course I regretted the subsequent losses of life of  
some of the boys... But I do not regret whatsoever...having 
harbored these youths and protected them from the vicious system 
of the day,'' she said. 
	 Witnesses had described her leading a double life as an icon  
of the war against apartheid and wife of Nelson Mandela and as 
an architect of a reign of terror in the vast Soweto township. 
	 Madikizela-Mandela's lawyer, Ishmail Semenya, led her  
through the allegations made since Monday last week and she 
calmly denied each in turn, often with the word ``ludicrous.''
