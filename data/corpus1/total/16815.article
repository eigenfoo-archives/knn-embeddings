bitter-sweet triumph Sunday, leading the French left to an upset 
parliamentary election victory which will require it to share 
power with conservative President Jacques Chirac. 
	 The Socialists' narrow victory over the governing  
center-right coalition could also commit him to power-sharing 
with possibly fractious Communist and Green parties, which he 
likely will have to rely on to form a government. 
	 It has nonetheless been a stunning rise to power for the  
59-year-old Jospin, whose highest public office to date was a 
four-year stint, beginning in 1988, as education minister under 
the late Francois Mitterrand. 
	 The tall, lean professorial figure nonetheless has gained  
plenty of experience in managing political rivalry, as leader of 
a Socialist Party plagued by infighting before and after 
Mitterrand's death in January 1996. 
	 The leftist victory is bound to elicit comparisons of Jospin  
to Britain's Tony Blair, the golden boy who led Labour to crush 
thew ruling Conservatives just a month ago. 
	 But the two men are very different and ran quite different  
campaigns, responding to very different political environments. 
	 Blair, reacting to Britain's sharp swing to the right under  
Conservative rule, reshaped his party to rebuild its 
credibility. 
	 France's political landscape has had little time to change  
since the Socialists last governed, just four years ago. And 
Jospin, who has led the party for only two years, lacked the 
time to make fundamental shifts in the Socialist program, or 
even to put an indelible stamp on its leadership. 
	 Jospin nonetheless tried to harness Blair's excitement in  
the French campaign, announcing that a leftist win would stun 
but also cheer Europe. 
	 ``We are on the brink of an event that is going to astound  
Europe, but it will also raise a magnificent hope in Europe 
after the victory of the leftist Labour Party in Great 
Britain,'' Jospin told a campaign rally a few days ago. 
	 Wherever Jospin ultimately leads the French people, his win  
will dictate an immediate and profound change at the top. 
	 For President Chirac, ``cohabitation'' -- as the French call  
power sharing -- with Jospin will clearly be more difficult than 
working with outgoing Prime Minister Alain Juppe, his most loyal 
and longest-serving political associate. 
	 Cohabitation will tie France's main political forces into a  
straitjacket for at least one year -- the legal period before 
Chirac could next play the dissolution card -- and possibly 
until the end of the president's seven-year term in 2002. 
	 Jospin's steady nerves and cool manner will be assets in  
fencing with the impulsive president, as well as with leftist 
allies hostile to plans for a single European currency. 
	 Despite a lack of charisma, Jospin in the election campaign  
came to embody voter resentment at Juppe's authoritarian style, 
record unemployment, unpopular reforms aimed at helping France 
qualify for European monetary union, and corruption in the 
ruling center-right coalition. 
	 Though witty and amiable in private, easily slipping into  
slang, he refused on the campaign trail to play to the gallery, 
standing stiffly at rallies and reading his speeches as if he 
were still a university lecturer. 
	 Television crews were hard-pressed to find sharp  
sound-bites, and photographers complained that his generous 
silver curls bounced light off his face, erasing all contrast. 
	 He describes himself as ``warm, straightforward and simple''  
and says he knows how to have fun, but concedes: ``A sense of 
modesty cramps and confines me a little.'' 
	 A television puppet satire show long portrayed him as  
``Yoyo,'' a well-meaning simpleton based on Enid Blyton's 
``Noddy,'' driving round in a toy car seeking ideas. 
	 Jospin scored points in the campaign by suggesting that  
Chirac's decision to call a snap election masked a secret agenda 
by the center-right -- a swing to ``hardline capitalism,'' more 
austerity to qualify for a single currency and an amnesty to 
pardon political sleaze. 
	 Even before Chirac announced he was dissolving parliament,  
Jospin denounced the move as ``an admission of failure'' when an 
election was not due until March 1998. 
	 The ruling coalition spluttered denials but failed to  
produce convincing reasons for the election. Chirac said it was 
intended to give France a ``new elan'' to help join a single 
European currency.
