suspected IRA bomb warnings paralyzed rail and road traffic in 
northern England Friday in what appeared to be the latest 
attempt by the guerrillas to disrupt Britain's election 
campaign. 
	 There were small explosions at railway stations in Doncaster  
and Leeds in northern England. Police said they carried out a 
controlled explosion on a package they suspected could be a bomb 
at Stoke station in the northwest. 
	 In Leeds, a large part of the city center was sealed off  
after the explosion, for which there was no warning. ``It was a 
loud but relatively small explosion along the trackside in an 
equipment cabinet,'' said a spokesman for the fire brigade. 
	 ``As our train went past there was a big bang and everyone  
started screaming and holding their heads,'' a woman passenger 
told the BBC. There were no reports of any injuries. 
	 Stoke, Doncaster and Crewe railway station were all closed  
after police were told of telephoned bomb warnings in which the 
caller gave a codeword known to be used by the outlawed Irish 
Republican Army (IRA). 
	 A large section of the main M6 motorway, linking southern  
Britain with the northwest, was also closed after a phone call 
threatening a bomb explosion. 
	 The M6 closure was near a sports stadium that Prime Minister  
John Major was due to visit Friday. ``This is not a coincidence, 
is it?'' one aide said. 
	 Major went ahead with his plans to campaign in the north  
ahead of the May 1 election. A bomb disposal squad was on hand 
throughout Major's visit. 
	 It was the second time Major's campaign tour has been  
disrupted by IRA threats. The last was on April 5 when a bomb 
warning forced the cancellation of the Grand National Horse Race 
while the prime minister was in the region. 
	 The alerts caused severe disruption in the region, blocking  
traffic and trains between the north and south and forcing the 
evacuation of homes and businesses around the threatened areas. 
	 Major pinned the incidents on the IRA, which is battling to  
end Britain's rule of Northern Ireland and had admitted causing 
traffic disruption earlier in the campaign for a May 1 election. 
	 ``This looks very much at the moment as though this is the  
work of the IRA showing their usual contempt for people's lives 
and for property,'' Major told his daily news conference. 
	 The IRA also set off a huge explosion in London's financial  
district in 1992 on the day that Major was re-elected. 
	 Last month, two bombs exploded near Wilmslow railway station  
in northwest England, but no one was injured, and Semtex bombs 
were found planted on the M6 earlier this month. 
	 Bomb threats at London railway stations have brought chaos  
to the capital several times in the past few weeks. The IRA has 
claimed responsibility for most of the explosions and threats.
