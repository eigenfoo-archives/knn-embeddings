expelled 12 foreigners on Sunday from troubled Chiapas state, 
hauling them off by force after saying they led a renegade town 
council in support of Zapatista rebels. 
	 As the foreigners were put onto a plane in the Chiapas state  
capital of Tuxtla Gutierrez, police beat two international news 
photographers with their rifle butts and attempted to confiscate 
their film, the photographers said. 
	 The foreigners -- three Americans, two Canadians, four  
Spaniards, two Belgians and one German -- said they were merely 
observers. 
	 But Interior Ministry officials told a news conference in  
Mexico City late Sunday that said they were caught red-handed 
playing leadership roles in one of the 32 self-described 
''autonomous'' governments that compete with local authorities 
in Chiapas. 
	 The foreigners and eight Mexicans were arrested on Saturday  
when Chiapas state officials dissolved the ``Ricardo Flores 
Magon Autonomous Community'' that operated within the 
municipality of Ocosingo, Chiapas. 
	 They shouted, ``We are innocent,'' ``This is illegal'' and  
''There is no proof'' when they were put on a bus in the 
highlands of Chiapas, some 500 miles southeast of Mexico City. 
	 From there they were flown to Mexico City and placed on  
commercial flights to their countries of origin, Miguel Covian, 
a top Interior Ministry official, told a news conference. 
	 Photographer Pascual Gorriz of The Associated Press told  
Reuters he was bleeding from the head after state police smacked 
him with a rifle butt at the airport as police were assisting 
immigration authorities in expelling the foreigners. 
Photographer Oriana Elicabe of Agence France Presse also said 
she was beaten. 
	 Covian also said officials had no knowledge of the alleged  
attack on journalists. 
	 Covian said Chiapas state officials witnessed the foreign  
activists participate in a shadow town hall meeting, which 
violated the Mexican constitution by usurping the power of local 
authorities. Foreigners are banned from participating in 
politics in Mexico. 
	 Mexico has thrown out more than 200 foreigners from Chiapas  
since 1997 for unauthorized activity, officials said at the news 
conference. The 12 this weekend were caught in part of a 
high-profile crackdown launched after the Dec. 22 massacre of 45 
Indian refugees who also supported the Zapatistas. 
	 Zapatista rebels took over several Chiapas cities Jan. 1,  
1994. After 10 days of fighting, the Zapatistas and the 
government entered a peace process that broke down in September 
1996. About 150 people died in combat, but since then hundreds 
of civilians have been killed in related violence. 
	 Thousands of foreigners have flocked to Chiapas, one of  
Mexico's poorest states, in support of the Zapatistas and their 
charismatic leader, the pipe-smoking Subcommander Marcos. 
	 Some 32 pro-Zapatista communities have declared themselves  
''autonomous'' from the traditional authorities in a key symbol 
of defiance against the government. 
	 When asked if authorities planned to break up the other 31  
autonomous communities, Covian said, ``No determination has been 
made in that respect because that is a decision for the state of 
Chiapas.'' 
	 The Interior Ministry identified those expelled as: Pilar  
Ana Lopez Castillejas, Olga Claveria Ian, Maria Sanchez Zaragoza 
and Julen Cobos Errasti of Spain; John Savato Michael, Travis 
Blaize Loller, and Jeffrey Wright Conant of the United States; 
Julie Marquette and Sarah Mireille Baillargeon of Canada; 
Charles Marie Lambot Gautier and Jean Dominique Bergere of 
Belgium; and Marion Silke Ladich of Germany. 
	 Mexican officials could not verify the spelling of the names  
nor whether some of their given names and surnames were listed 
out of order.
