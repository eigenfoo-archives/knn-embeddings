harsh and very swift'' punishment of the bombers behind an 
attack on a U.S. military complex that killed 19 Americans and 
wounded nearly 400 people. 
	 But Saudi and U.S. officials said they had little idea who  
carried out Tuesday's attack at the King Abdul-Aziz airbase in 
Khobar, the second in eight months against a U.S. military 
target in the strictly Islamic kingdom. 
	 Condemnation of the bombing flowed in from Saudi Arabia's  
Gulf Arab neighbors and Western allies of the vastly wealthy oil 
kingdom, whose military program has meant lucrative contracts in 
Europe and the United States. 
	 U.S. President Bill Clinton, who received a telephone call  
>from  Saudi King Fahd expressing condolences, vowed to punish the 
``murderous act.'' 
	 U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, changing the  
itinerary of a Middle East visit, left Cairo for Saudi Arabia to 
visit wounded servicemen. 
	 ``We will not rest until these terrorists are brought to  
justice...we will hunt them down,'' he said before leaving. 
	 The explosion from a parked fuel truck ripped off the entire  
facade of a residential block and carved out a huge crater 
outside. Saudi television showed pictures of torn mattresses, 
mangled televisions and furniture and melted video players 
lodged among slabs of fallen concrete as bulldozers cleared away 
mounds of rubble and twisted metal. 
	 The Saudi Interior Ministry and the Pentagon put the number  
of deaths at 19 Americans. The Pentagon said 64 Americans were 
seriously wounded and the Saudis said a total of 386 people were 
hurt, including 147 Saudi nationals, 118 Bangladeshis, 109 
Americans, four Egyptians, two Jordanians, two Indonesians and 
two Filipinas. 
	 U.S. Air Force planes left Germany for Saudi Arabia to begin  
picking up victims. The main U.S. military hospital in Europe 
was also put on alert, a U.S. Air Force spokesman said. 
	 No group has claimed responsibility for the bomb attack, the  
worst against U.S. interests in the Middle East since 241 U.S. 
Marines and sailors were killed in Beirut in 1983. 
	 In Saudi Arabia in November, five Americans and two Indians  
were killed in a bomb attack on a U.S.-run military training 
center in Riyadh. 
	 A senior Arab diplomat said of the latest bombing: ``The  
attack was very professionally executed. The method used was 
different from the Riyadh car bomb but the target is the same. 
It is too early to speculate who did it.'' 
	 Israeli President Ezer Weizman blamed Iran.  
	 Another Saudi official said: ``Saudi Arabia is determined to  
pursue the criminals, apprehend them and bring them to justice. 
Those who did it will not go unpunished. 
	 He also said the attack would not affect the kingdom's  
strong ties with the United States. 
	 Riyadh offered a 10 million riyals ($2.67 million) reward  
for help in securing arrests. Road blocks were set up throughout 
Saudi Arabia's eastern region. 
	 A Saudi official in Washington promised ``very harsh and  
very swift'' punishment for whoever set off the bomb. 
	 Four Saudi nationals were headed in Saudi Arabia last month  
for the Riyadh bombing. The government said they were influenced 
by Islamic groups outside the kingdom, including dissident 
Mohammad al-Masari and financier Osama bin-Ladin. 
	 Masari, who is waging a campaign against the Saudi royal  
family, has denied the charge from his exile in London. 
	 Analysts and diplomats said the blast posed the biggest  
internal security challenge to the kingdom in nearly two 
decades, when Muslim militants took over Islam's holiest shrine 
the Grand Mosque and hundreds of people were killed. 
	 ``This shows there are deep feelings of anti-Americanism  
among militants. The fact that they were able to carry out such 
an operation means there may be more in store,'' a Saudi analyst 
said. 
	 Saudi Arabia, like other Gulf Arab states, has been mostly  
concerned with security threats from Iraq and Iran since Baghdad 
invaded Kuwait in 1990 and has increasingly looked to its key 
ally Washington for security assurances. 
	 But homegrown militancy has gained momentum since the Gulf  
War, when fundamentalists were incensed at the influx of half a 
million mostly U.S. soldiers on Islamic Saudi soil. 
	 ``There are pockets of dissent against the Americans and the  
authorities and the two bombs obviously show that these feelings 
are growing,'' said a Western diplomat. 
	 Power in Saudi Arabia has since it was established in 1932  
rested in the hands of the al-Saud royal family. The kingdom has 
remained an absolute monarchy without legislature or political 
parties. Islamic sharia law prevails. 
	 Outrage at the bombing came rapidly from France, Italy,  
Ireland, Belgium, Germany and Russia and across much of the Arab 
world. British Prime Minister John Major called it ``an act of 
pure evil.'' 
	 Squadrons of U.S. F-15s, British-made Tornado jets and  
training aircraft are stationed at the base, which is also used 
by members of the Gulf War coalition to enforce United Nations 
sanctions imposed against Iraq since its invasion of Kuwait.
