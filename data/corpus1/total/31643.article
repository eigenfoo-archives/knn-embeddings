assess the damage inflicted on their homes by devastating 
flooding. 
	 Rescuers tried to reach people stranded when an earth dam  
gave way in Alabama, where state governor Fob James declared a 
state of emergency in the southern half of the state. 
	 He mobilized the National Guard to evacuate stranded people  
and sandbag flooded areas in Elba, about 60 miles south of 
Montgomery. 
	 ``We've had 2,000 people evacuated in Elba, and we've got a  
lot of National Guard missions ongoing to assist with all types 
of different emergencies,'' said Scott Adcock of the Alabama 
Emergency Management Agency. 
	 Adcock said many roads had been washed away and rescuers  
were trying to make temporary repairs so emergency vehicles 
could get through. 
	 Southern rivers that broke their banks over the weekend  
began to recede Monday afternoon as the rain eased. 
	 Since the storms started, five people, including a  
20-month-old baby, have been drowned in southern states and two 
-- one of them a man fishing for bass -- have been killed by 
lightning. 
	 In the Midwest, where a cold front dumped heavy snow and  
froze road surfaces, four people died in weather-related traffic 
accidents. 
	 Tornadoes ripped through central Florida, but no deaths were  
reported. 
	 Central Florida, where tornadoes killed 42 people two weeks  
ago, endured another round of twisters. Storms Sunday night and 
Monday damaged mobile homes and tore roofs off some buildings. 
	 Authorities in Lake Wales said 10 homes were destroyed and  
four people were injured. 
	 In the Midwest, a powerful snowstorm packing heavy winds cut  
off power to hundreds of thousands of people, causing traffic 
chaos and closing many schools Monday. 
	 The onslaught found many motorists unprepared and four  
traffic deaths over the weekend were blamed on the weather. 
	 Even snowplows became stuck in the blizzard conditions as  
authorities organized rescue attempts for stranded travelers. 
  Ice and snow storms also battered parts of Missouri, Iowa,  
Indiana and Wisconsin, where roads were littered with jack- 
knifed trucks, police said.
