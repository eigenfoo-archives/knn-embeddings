bomber Timothy McVeigh rested their case Wednesday after a 
four-day assault on the FBI's scientific investigation and the 
credibility of government witnesses. 
	 The defense case was brief and streamlined -- just 25  
witnesses -- compared to the prosecution's 137 witnesses in 18 
days. 
	 Closing arguments begin Thursday, with jury deliberations to  
follow. The 29-year-old Gulf War veteran faces the death penalty 
if convicted in the April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. 
Murrah building that left 168 dead and more than 500 injured. 
	 McVeigh's attorneys concentrated on an attack on the motives  
of government witnesses, questioned the FBI's handling of 
evidence and called their own witnesses to undermine the 
prosecution. 
	 After defense testimony ended, lead government prosecutor  
Joe Hartzler appeared exuberant and confident, giving a 
''high-five'' greeting to a friend. 
	 Denver trial attorney Scott Robinson gave the defense effort  
a mixed review, saying, ``The defense did a remarkable job ... 
representing the most hated man in America. They did attack 
almost every aspect of the government's case. But what they 
didn't do was explain away the evidence against McVeigh.'' 
	 Missing from the defense case were theories once promoted by  
defense attorney Stephen Jones that the bombing may have been 
the work of right-wing extremists based in America or overseas. 
	 McVeigh's attorneys had made several trips out of the  
country, part of what published reports said was a $10 million 
defense effort. 
	 On the last day of testimony, defense attorneys played  
wire-tapped telephone conversations designed to discredit star 
prosecution witness Michael Fortier. He can be heard telling 
friends he knew McVeigh and hoped to make ``one cool mill'' -- 
or $1 million -- by selling his story to the media. 
	 ``I'll just give them something juicy,'' he said, adding he  
knew nothing about McVeigh's alleged crimes. He described 
McVeigh as having been ``in the wrong place at the wrong time.'' 
	 Fortier and his wife Lori testified earlier that McVeigh  
told them of his rage toward the federal government and his 
plans to bomb the federal building in Oklahoma City. 
	 While the couple said they did not tell authorities the  
truth because they were implicated and terrified, Fortier made 
no mention on the tapes of being scared. 
	 The defense, hoping questions about the FBI's investigation  
could induce jurors to question its findings, focused on 
standards and procedures at the agency's crime lab. 
	 The lab was found contaminated with explosives residue just  
weeks after the bombing, FBI agent Frederic Whitehurst 
testified. But he said he had no proof any evidence was tainted. 
	 He cast doubt on the ammonium nitrate, said to be a key  
ingredient in the bomb, found by the FBI on a piece of the Ryder 
truck allegedly used in the blast. Whitehurst said the chemicals 
should in fact have been washed away by rain. 
	 The jury also heard British explosives expert John Lloyd say  
he was unconvinced by the FBI findings. He questioned the 
residue found on McVeigh's clothing and earplugs. If McVeigh 
handled as much ammonium nitrate as the government claimed, he 
said, traces should have turned up elsewhere, such as on his 
boots or in his car. No traces were found. 
	 The chemical residue was the prosecution's best scientific  
evidence against McVeigh, who was wearing the clothes when he 
was arrested soon after the blast by a state trooper who noticed 
his car was missing a license plate. 
	 His attorneys also raised the specter of ``John Doe No. 2,''  
an unidentified suspect who was never found. They proposed that 
an unidentified leg -- found at the bomb site and never 
explained -- could have belonged to the actual bomber.
