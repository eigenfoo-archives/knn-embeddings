wounded 31 Palestinians with rubber bullets Wednesday as violent 
clashes raged on in the West Bank city of Hebron over the 
impasse in Middle East peacemaking. 
	 The street battles flared a day after the heaviest bloodshed  
in the West Bank since the crisis began last month with 
groundbreaking for new Jewish housing in the eastern sector of 
Jerusalem, captured by Israel in the 1967 war. 
	 Mourners picked up rocks as they left the funeral of one of  
three Arabs shot to death in the partitioned, flashpoint city 
Tuesday and charged through a ragged line of unarmed Palestinian 
police to confront Israeli soldiers in full battle gear. 
	 Hundreds of youths, many from the Islamic fundamentalist  
Hamas group, surged down a strike-bound shopping street, hurling 
stones and gasoline bombs at soldiers guarding Jewish settler 
enclaves in the heart of the city of 100,000 Arabs. 
	 Hospitals said they treated 31 youths for wounds from  
rubber-coated metal bullets. Three were hit in the head. 
Israel's army radio said three Israeli soldiers and two 
Palestinian policemen were injured by stones. 
	 On the diplomatic front there was little sign of progress to  
revive peace moves, halted last month when Israel started work 
on the new housing. 
	 Israel insists the Palestinians stop all clashes before  
resuming talks while the Palestinians demand that Israel halt 
the new housing and other settlement activity, which Israeli 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu refuses. 
	 Back from crisis talks in Washington with President Clinton,  
Netanyahu told visiting foreign mayors that U.S. efforts to 
salvage Middle East peace would take time. 
	 ``I think that these will be ongoing discussions. I think  
the United States will talk to the Palestinians, they will talk 
to us again, talk to the Palestinians again -- it will require a 
process before we have a result,'' he said. 
	 Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat held fruitless talks with  
top Israeli and U.S. intelligence officials in the self-ruled 
Gaza Strip Tuesday on restoring security cooperation with 
Israel, Palestinian officials said. 
	 They said CIA and Israeli officials asked Arafat to order  
his security chiefs to resume cooperation with Israel to prevent 
violence but the security chiefs refused until Israel resumed 
contacts at all levels, including peace talks. 
	 On the rock-strewn streets of Hebron, a Palestinian blamed  
the hard-line Israeli leader for the violence. 
	 ``What you are seeing today and every day is a result of  
Netanyahu's stupid provocation at Jabal Abu Ghneim,'' he said, 
referring to the site of the new housing project. 
	 But Netanyahu said: ``The first principle that President  
Clinton and I discussed and agreed upon is that there must be an 
absolute condemnation and battle against terrorism on the 
Palestinian side because this is the first condition...of 
peace.'' 
	 Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said he was leaving for  
Washington Wednesday with chief Palestinian negotiator Mahmoud 
Abbas, better known as Abu Mazen, for talks on launching a U.S. 
peace initiative. 
	 Palestinians had hoped Clinton would pressure Netanyahu to  
stop the plans to build 6,500 homes for Jews between Jerusalem 
and Bethlehem, completing a ring of settlements which they say 
pre-empts talks on the future of east Jerusalem. 
	 ``Clinton asked Netanyahu to freeze settlement building.  
Netanyahu said he would not,'' a U.S. diplomat, who asked not to 
be identified, told Reuters. 
	 Marwan Kanafani, an Arafat spokesman, rejected any notion  
that the Palestinians would accept a deal that did not include 
halting work on the housing. 
	 ``I would discard this report. We are not going to  
compromise on settlement activities,'' Kanafani said in Gaza. 
	 Jibril Rajoub, Palestinian security chief in the West Bank,  
denied his men were slow to quell protests. 
	 Rajoub rejected Netanyahu's claim that the Palestinian  
Authority, which governs major West Bank cities under elements 
of a peace deal already put into force, was weak on curbing 
terrorism. 
	 ``We are facing the worst two kinds of terrorism, occupation  
and settlement,'' he told Reuters.
