says no more storms are headed toward the flood-ravaged Northwest, and 
many of the swollen rivers are beginning to recede as rains that ravaged 
the region the past week have lessened or stopped. 
	But the misery from the storms and raging waters is far from over. At  
least a dozen people have reportedly been killed in weather-related 
incidents since Christmas. 
	In California, thousands of people have fled for higher ground along  
the Feather River north of Sacramento because a break in the levee late 
Thursday created a 10-square-mile lake overnight. About 90,000 people 
have been evacuated in the flood area. 
	In Oregon, the National Guard is helping provide drinking water to  
approximately 22,000 people because a treatment plant near Ashland was 
contaminated by flood water. 
	Officials say heavy rains have fizzled to scattered showers and  
swollen rivers are receding in the eastern part of the state, but in 
southern Oregon, emergency officials continue to fight floods and hope 
that water levels will have a chance to subside before more rain falls. 
	The floodwaters are receding in Carson City and in Reno, Nev., where  
the worst floods in 40 years left casinos, homes and businesses in up to 
10 feet of water. The city airport reopened Friday after two days 
underwater. 
	Four counties in Nevada were declared a disaster area Friday by  
President Clinton, and California, Idaho, Oregon and Washington are also 
asking for federal help.
