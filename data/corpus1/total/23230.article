Haiti on Nov. 30, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 
said after meeting with President Rene Preval at the National 
Palace Friday. 
	 ``President Preval and I both agreed that the U.N. military  
mission will be over in November,'' said Albright. 
	 About 1,000 Pakistani and Canadian troops are currently  
patrolling Haiti's streets. 
	 Foreign troops landed in Haiti in September 1994, when  
20,000 U.S. troops restored President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to 
power, three years after he was ousted by a military coup. 
	 Albright said she was impressed with progress made by the  
Haitian National Police, the internationally trained civilian 
force which replaced the repressive military after it was 
disbanded by Aristide in 1995. 
	 Other kinds of continuing international security assistance  
were discussed, according to Albright, who said no final 
decisions had been made. 
	 Before leaving the palace for a meeting with  
parliamentarians, Albright publicly rebuked the legislators for 
political disputes that have blocked normal functioning of the 
Haitian government for months. 
	 ``Disputes in parliament are the lifeblood of a democracy,  
but in Haiti it has gone on too long, with a government that has 
been paralyzed,'' she said. 
	 Preval has held meetings in recent weeks to resolve an  
electoral crisis, which is at the center of partisan bickering. 
The second run-off of April 6 senatorial elections was postponed 
indefinitely due to allegations of fraud. 
	 The nine senate seats are still left empty.  
	 Haiti has been virtually without a government since the  
resignation of Prime Minister Rosny Smarth in June. Smarth 
resigned amid the electoral controversy and sometimes-violent 
opposition to his government's plans to privatize nine state-run 
enterprises. 
	 Replacements for Smarth and his entire cabinet have not been  
approved by parliament. 
	 The deadlock has left the country in an economic tailspin,  
and hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign aid remain 
blocked pending parliamentary approval of various administrative 
and economic laws. 
	 Preval and Albright also signed a drug interdiction  
agreement in which the U.S. Coast Guard can pursue ships into 
Haitian waters and board them to search for narcotics. 
	 The U.S. considers the agreement important to stopping the  
flow of drugs through the Caribbean, where Haiti is a major 
transshipment point.
