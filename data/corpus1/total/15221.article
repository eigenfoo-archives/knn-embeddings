Palestinians Saturday in the West Bank as Israeli Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu considered forming a ``national unity'' 
government to cope with the Middle East peace crisis. 
	 Palestinian witnesses said the soldiers intervened in the  
town of Hebron where Jewish settlers and Palestinians threw 
stones at one another in an area under Israeli security control. 
	 ``All of a sudden the soldiers started shooting at  
Palestinians wounding six, but their injuries were not 
critical,'' one Palestinian witness said. 
	 Israeli-Palestinian peace moves have faltered and violence  
has flared since Netanyahu sent bulldozers a month ago to break 
ground on a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem which 
Palestinians say violates peace deals and international law. 
	 ``The Zionist enemy understands only the language of  
force,'' said Khaled Mishaal, leader of the Islamic Hamas group 
which has spearheaded opposition to Israel-PLO peace moves. 
	 Since the building began, Israeli airwaves have buzzed with  
reports of contacts between Netanyahu's Likud party and the 
left-center Labor party which led Israel to a breakthrough 1993 
interim accord with the PLO and subsequent peace deals. 
	 Netanyahu confirmed what had been rumored for weeks during  
several weekend interviews with Israeli reporters in Italy where 
he is on an official visit. 
	 ``I am already thinking about it...but I haven't reached a  
conclusion,'' said Netanyahu when asked if he would consider 
forming a government with the main opposition Labor party. 
	 ``I have consulted with friends, with several ministers in  
the government...Some have clear answers, some are wavering like 
I am on this matter,'' he told Israel Television Friday. 
	 The right-wing Netanyahu, elected last May, opposed the  
agreements with the PLO but has promised to honor them. His 
religious and ultra-nationalist coalition partners accuse him of 
ceding too much to Palestinian President Yasser Arafat. 
	 An Israeli decision last month to pull troops out of nine  
percent of the West Bank barely passed in Netanyahu's cabinet. 
Arafat refused the offer, saying he had expected three times as 
much land. 
	 ``If we are approached (about forming a national unity  
government), we will discuss it,'' said Labor party leader 
Shimon Peres, who helped engineer the PLO peace deals but lost 
last year's election to Netanyahu. 
	 Peres, a Nobel peace prize laureate, has said a unity  
government is the only way to save peace moves with the PLO and 
other Arab partners. 
	 But he has formally postponed the issue until a criminal  
investigation against members of Netanyahu's cabinet is cleared 
up. Police have said the probe will last several more weeks. 
	 Netanyahu has proposed defusing the crisis with the PLO by  
skipping interim steps and launching intensive talks to seal a 
final peace agreement within six to nine months. 
	 ``I am considering one fundamental question...will expanding  
the government bring about a better result in our ability to 
conduct these negotiations (with the PLO) and complete them?'' 
said Netanyahu. 
	 Israel said Saturday it would allow 20,000 Palestinians to  
enter the Jewish state for work, easing a closure imposed on the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip after a Palestinian bombing last month. 
	 The army sealed off the West Bank and Gaza on March 21 after  
an Islamic militant killed three Israeli women at a Tel Aviv 
cafe and died himself when a bomb he intended to plant there 
exploded prematurely.
