anti-government protests in several Indonesian cities Monday, with 
one small group here trying to march on the house of the ousted 
president shouting "Suharto surrender," witnesses and reports said. 
   Many of the mass demonstrations were held on campuses to mourn  
seven students who died in clashes with soldiers at the weekend. 
   The bloody clashes between students and soldiers and the mass  
rioting that followed here on Saturday left 14 dead and 448 injured, 
state media said. 
   At Jakarta's Trisakti University, thousands of students wearing  
black armbands held a free speeech forum, while another group of 
some 40 students said they would head for the national parliament 
complex. 
   Some 100 students of the Indonesian Moslem Student Association  
marched in central Jakarta to condemn the military violence and call 
for the resignation of armed forces chief General Wiranto, a witness 
said. 
   Scores of troops, including marines, were keeping an eye on both  
marches but did not intervene. 
   Another 300 students were massed in front of the Jakarta police  
headquarters near a cloverleaf intersection that was the scene of 
the worst violence Friday night. 
   They were shouting three demands -- that one of their comrades  
be released from detention, that the military get out of politics, 
and that the military which in Indonesia includes the police account 
for Friday's clashes. 
   Some 40 students representing five groups started to march to  
the residence of Suharto, whom they charge with corruption and abuse 
of power during his 32 years in power, demanding he surrender 
himself to the authorities. 
   "Suharto, immediately surrender yourself" said one poster they  
carried, while others read "Suharto is the master puppeteer behind 
all disasters" and "Bring to trial Suharto, his family and all his 
cronies." 
   The students also yelled "People unite, bring Suharto to court,"  
while some shouted "Wiranto resign." 
   But mid-afternoon, after being blocked by marines at a  
crossroads on Diponogoro Avenue near the residence of the US 
ambassador, they turned back about one kilometres (0.6 miles) from 
the former strongman's residence. 
   Students told reporters they were not willing to risk the lives  
of farmers who had joined the march. 
   Their decision was made shortly fter three truckloads of KOSTRAD  
strategic command troops pulled into the area. 
   Another group of some 50 students, from the Student People's  
Committee for Democracy, who set out to march to parliament from 
central Jakarta, had stopped near a major downtown roundabout. 
   Thousands of students from several universities in the central  
Sulawesi city of Palu Monday occupied the local provincial 
parliament building to protest the results of the four-day special 
session of the country's highest legislative body that ended on 
Friday, the Antara news agency said. 
   In Bandung, West Java province, five universities held rallies  
in honor of the students who died in the clashes in Jakarta the day 
the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) ended its session, police 
there said. 
   Student protestors have charged the MPR is a remnant of the  
discredited regime of Suharto, who resigned in May following 
widespread rioting.
